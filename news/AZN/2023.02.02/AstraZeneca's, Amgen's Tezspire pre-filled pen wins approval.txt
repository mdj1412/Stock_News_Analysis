(Alliance News) - AstraZeneca PLC and Amgen Inc on Thursday said their severe asthma drug Tezspire has been approved in the form of a pre-filled pen by the US Food & Drug Administration for self-administration for people aged 12 and over.Cambridge, England-based pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and California-based biotechnology company Amgen said Tezspire is the "first and only respiratory biologic without phenotype or biomarker limitations that offers the choice of administration at home or in a doctor's office." Biologics are drugs that slow or stop inflammation. The companies cite a phase III trial that showed that 92% of healthcare providers, patients and caregivers were able to successfully inject Tezspire in a clinical and a home setting. Kenneth Mendez, President & Chief Executive Officer of the Asthma & Allergy Foundation of America, said: "Severe asthma continues to be a very complex condition to manage, so we welcome the Tezspire pre-filled pen as an option that will empower patients and healthcare providers with increased choice. We believe self-administration alternatives can play an important role in patients' lives and address unmet needs for those living with severe asthma."AstraZeneca shares were virtually unchanged at 10,284.00 pence each in London on Thursday afternoon, while Amgen shares were down 4.0% at USD236.64 in New York.By Tom Budszus, Alliance News reporterComments and questions to newsroom@alliancenews.comCopyright 2023 Alliance News Ltd.
