*Global shares edge up*Correlation with dollar softens*Yen takes a breather from recent rallyLONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The dollar headed for its
largest one-day rise in over three months on Tuesday, while
equities rallied in a macro-packed week that could offer a steer
on when, and at what level, U.S. interest rates might peak.The MSCI All-World index was roughly
unchanged, although European stocks, led by hefty gains in
anything from financials, to oil and gas stocks, to healthcare,
bounced to two-week highs.Typically, stocks tend to fall when the dollar gains, but
that negative correlation between the two softened on Tuesday to
its weakest since early September. The dollar index was
last up 1% at 104.69.The euro was the worst-performing currency against the
dollar, falling by the most since late September,
after German regional inflation data showed consumer price
pressures eased sharply in December, thanks in large part to
government measures to contain natural gas bills for households
and businesses.Data on U.S. payrolls this week are expected to show the
labour market remains tight, while EU consumer prices could show
some slowdown in inflation as energy prices ease."Energy base effects will bring about a sizeable reduction
in inflation in the major economies in 2023, but stickiness in
core components, much of this stemming from tight labour
markets, will prevent an early dovish policy 'pivot' by central
banks," analysts at NatWest Markets wrote in a note.They expect interest rates to top out at 5% in the United
States, 2.25% in the EU and 4.5% in Britain and to stay there
for the entire year. Markets, on the other hand, are pricing in
rate cuts for late 2023, with fed fund futures implying
a range of 4.25 to 4.5% by December."The thing that makes me nervous about this year is that we
still do not know the full impact of the very significant
monetary tightening that's taken place across the advanced
world," Berenberg senior economist Kallum Pickering said."It takes a good year, or 18 months, for the full effect to
kick in," he said.Central banks have expressed concern about rising wages,
even as consumers have struggled to keep up with the soaring
cost of living and companies are running out of room to protect
their profitability by raising their own prices.But, Pickering said, the labour market tends to lag the
broader economy by some time, meaning that there is a risk that
central banks could be raising interest rates by more than the
economy can withstand."What central banks are inducing is essentially excess
cyclicality, which is - they overstimulated in 2021 and
triggered an inflationary boom and then overtightened in 2022
and triggered a disinflationary recession. It’s exactly the
opposite of what you want central banks to do," he said.Investors will get their first insight into central bank
thinking later this week when the Federal Reserve releases the
minutes from its December policy meeting.The minutes will likely show many members saw risks that
interest rates would need to go higher for longer, but investors
are conscious of how much they've risen already.On the markets, European shares rose thanks to gains in
classic defensive sectors, such as healthcare and food and
beverages. Drugmakers Novo Nordisk, Astrazeneca
and Roche were among the biggest positive
weights on the STOXX 600, along with NestleThe STOXX, which lost 13% in 2022, rose 1.1%. The FTSE 100
, the only major European index not to trade on Monday,
rose 1.3%.U.S. stock index futures gained between 0.4-0.5%
, pointing to an upbeat start at the opening bell.Markets have for a while priced in an eventual U.S. easing,
but they were badly wrong-footed by the Bank of Japan's shock
upward shift in its ceiling for bond yields.The BOJ is now considering raising its inflation forecasts
in January to show price growth close to its 2% target in fiscal
2023 and 2024, according to the Nikkei.Such a move at its next policy meeting on Jan. 17-18 would
only add to speculation of an end to ultra-loose policy, which
has essentially acted as a floor for bond yields globally.The policy shift has boosted the yen across the board, with
the dollar losing 5% in December and the euro 2.3%.The yen took a breather on Tuesday, easing 0.3% against the
dollar to 130.96. The dollar earlier touched a six-month low of
129.52 yen. Against the dollar, the euro fell 1.1% to
$1.05395, having dropped by as much as 1.4% earlier in the day."A theme we’ve often noticed is the euro's negative
seasonality in January, down around 1.3% since 1980 on average
in January, with a 64% hit ratio. If history is any guide, it’s
a rough month for euro longs," Nomura strategist Jordan
Rochester said.Oil succumbed to the strength of the dollar, and reversed
course, falling as concern about demand in China, the world's
second largest economy, added to the downward momentum.A batch of surveys have shownChina's factory activity shrank
at the sharpest pace in nearly three years as COVID infections
swept through production lines."China is entering the most dangerous weeks of the
pandemic," warned analysts at Capital Economics.Brent crude lost 0.9% to trade around $85.15 a
barrel, having hit a session high of $87.00 earlier on.(Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Bradley Perrett, Sam
