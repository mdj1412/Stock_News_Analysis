(Alliance News) - Daiichi Sankyo Co Ltd on Monday said the first patient has been dosed in its Tropion-Lung07 phase 3 trial, which is evaluating a combination of treatments for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.The Tokyo-based pharmaceutical company said the trial would specifically evaluate datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), in combination with pembrolizumab with or without platinum chemotherapy, in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC.Datopotamab deruxtecan is a specifically engineered antibody drug conjugate being jointly developed by Daiichi and AstraZeneca PLC.Nearly half of those with NSCLC are diagnosed at an advanced stage and generally have a poor prognosis, Daiichi said."Metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer remains a challenge because the majority of patients experience disease progression following their initial treatment, underscoring the need for more effective treatment optionsin the first-line setting," said Mark Rutstein, managing director and global head of oncology clinical development at Daiichi. "The TROPION-Lung07 trial will assess the potential of the combination of datopotamab deruxtecan and pembrolizumab with and without chemotherapy, to evaluate whether this combination may be a more effective standard treatment option than the current standard of care for patients in the first-line setting." Cristian Massacesi, managing director, chief medical officer and oncology chief development officer at AstraZeneca, added: "The combination of datopotamab deruxtecan with a checkpoint inhibitor with orwithout chemotherapy, has shown increased activity and a manageable safety profile in early trials, including TROPION-Lung02."TROPION-Lung07 is the third clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement between Daiichi Sankyoand AstraZeneca alongside a subsidiary of Merck & Co Inc subsidiary to evaluate the combination ofdatopotamab deruxtecan and pembrolizumab. Previous clinical trial collaboration agreements were entered in October 2021 for the TROPION-Lung08 phase 3 trial and in May 2020 for the TROPION-Lung02 phase 1b trial.
