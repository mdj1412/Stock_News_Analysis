(Alliance News) - Stocks in London are set to open higher on Thursday, as investors seemed unfazed by the latest meeting minutes from the US Federal Reserve."The FTSE 100 looks set to underperform due to a host of big companies going ex-dividend, including GSK, AstraZeneca, Unilever and Barclays," said CMC Markets' Michael Hewson. IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 to open up 17.5 points, or 0.2%, at 7,948.13 on Thursday. The index of London large-caps ended down 47.12 points, or 0.6%, at 7,930.63 on Wednesday. The CAC 40 index in Paris was called up 0.4%, and the DAX in Frankfurt was called up 0.5%. "Last night's Fed minutes didn't tell the markets much that hadn't been deduced already given the recent comments from Mester and Bullard last week," Hewson commented.Since the February meeting, regional presidents James Bullard of St Louis and Loretta Mester of Cleveland have said they were among the group that wanted a more aggressive move at the January 31 to February 1 rate-setting meeeting.Although the 25 basis point rate hike was agreed upon, the minutes showed a "few" members said they wanted a half-point, or 50 basis points, hike that would show even greater resolve to get inflation down."What they did show however was that there was significant sympathy for a 50bps rate hike from a few FOMC members before they settled on the more gradual option of a 25bps rate rise," Hewson added. There was a fairly muted response on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending down 0.3%, the S&P 500 down 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.1%.The dollar was mixed against major currencies. Sterling was quoted at USD1.2074 early Thursday, higher than USD1.2066 at the London equities close on Wednesday. The euro traded at USD1.0627, unchanged from USD1.0629.
