That isn't entirely true, given that we now know that a number of other Fed officials share the view of Bullard and Mester that more needs to be done, and in light of the data since then that position will only have hardened further," said CMC Markets' Michael Hewson. There was a fairly muted response on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending down 0.3% and the S&P 500 down 0.2% but the Nasdaq Composite up 0.1%.The dollar was stronger against major currencies.Sterling was quoted at USD1.2052 early Thursday, lower than USD1.2066 at the London equities close on Wednesday.

The jet engine maker's annual revenue increased to GBP13.52 billion from GBP11.22 billion a year before, but its pretax loss widened to GBP1.50 billion from GBP294 million, due to GBP2.42 billion in net financing costs. Operating profit improved to GBP837 million from GBP513 million, however. CEO Tufan Erginbilgic said Rolls-Royce will begin a strategic review as part of its restructuring programme, and will share the findings and its medium term goals in the second half of 2023. Looking to 2023, the company noted a "continued recovery" in its end markets, and is confidence of higher profit and cash flow. "When Erginbilgic took over earlier this year he didn't hold back in the challenges facing the current business. Likening the company to a 'burning platform' his words pulled the shares off their recent highs, which where their highest levels since February last year," said CMC's Hewson. "The announcement of a strategic review of all the businesses should go some way to indicating how he intends to steer the company."WPP added 3.9% in early trading, boasting strong performance across all its major agencies in 2022. Ad agency said revenue in 2022 rose 13% to GBP14.43 billion from GBP12.80 billion in 2021. Revenue less pass-through costs rose 14% to GBP11.80 billion. Pretax profit jumped 22% to GBP1.16 billion from GBP951 million. WPP raised its dividend to 39.4p from 31.2p.

WPP expects like-for-like revenue less pass-through costs growth of 3% to 5% in 2023. "As a media giant, WPP has been stung by a global slowdown in marketing spending brought on my enormous geopolitical and economic stress. By all accounts this looks to be reversing, which has fed into strong growth at the end of the year," said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. At the other end of London's blue-chips was Mondi, down 6.3%.The packaging and paper company said revenue jumped 28% in 2022 to EUR8.90 billion from EUR6.97 billion a year before. Pretax profit more than doubled to EUR1.56 billion from EUR712 million. The figures are based on continuing operations, excluding its divested Russian operations. Mondi recommended a dividend of 70 euro cents, up 7.7% from 65 cents a year before. However, investors seemed perturbed by the firm's shaky outlook."Whilst a number of input costs are starting to decline, we continue to see an environment of softer demand and pricing, with destocking expected to continue through the first quarter," Mondi warned.
