      Alexion equity awards
    

      In accordance with the Agreement and Plan of Merger between the Company and Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion), Dr Sarin's in-flight share awards granted by Alexion were converted to awards over AstraZeneca ADSs under the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan at the time of closing of the Alexion acquisition. The awards that vested on 9 February 2023 replaced in-flight Alexion awards originally granted to Dr Sarin between February 2020 and February 2021 under the Alexion 2017 Incentive Plan.
    

      Restricted share award
    

      Dr Sarin's previous employment contract with Alexion included an entitlement to cash severance arrangements, which would have been triggered at the date of closing of the acquisition of Alexion. To compensate Dr Sarin for the forfeiture of these contractual entitlements an award of Â£2,015,540 was made in August 2021, 50% in cash and 50% in restricted shares. The restricted shares vested and were released to Dr Sarin on 9 February 2023, 18 months after her appointment.
    

      For tax purposes, the fair market value of an ADS at vest of the awards was US$64.36, being the closing price on the last trading day preceding the vesting. The fair market value of an Ordinary Share at vest was 10,572 pence, being the closing price on the last trading day preceding the vesting.
