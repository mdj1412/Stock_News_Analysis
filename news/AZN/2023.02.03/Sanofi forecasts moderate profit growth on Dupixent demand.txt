*Sees "low single digit" percentage core EPS growth, FX
adjusted*Established MS pill faces competition from cheaper
products*Shares down 3%, lowest since mid-November*CEO says Dupixent "mega-blockbuster" protected beyond 2031Feb 3 (Reuters) - Sanofi forecast moderate
earnings growth that undershot expectations, saying demand for
bestselling asthma and eczema drug Dupixent would be partly
offset by competition for its multiple sclerosis pill Aubagio
and product launch costs.The Paris-based drugmaker said on Friday it expected 2023
adjusted earnings per share to grow by a "low single digit"
percentage, not taking into account an expected negative
currency impact of between 3.5% and 4.5%.Aubagio, with 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) in sales last
year, will face competition from cheaper products over the next
few months after losing patent protection, Sanofi said.Sanofi shares were down 3% at 1107 GMT, having earlier
fallen as much as 5.2% to their lowest since mid-November with
JP Morgan analysts saying investors had expected a better 2023
outlook and a more benign view on foreign exchange headwinds.The company reaffirmed its target to achieve sales of
Dupixent, jointly developed with Regeneron, of 10
billion euros this year, up more than 20% from 8.29 billion
euros in 2022."The results today were mixed and there's still the
impression that Sanofi has a relatively weak development
pipeline," said Markus Manns, portfolio manager at Germany-based
Union Investment, which holds Sanofi stock.Sanofi shares have yet to recover from a plunge in August
following disappointing trial results of a once-promising breast
cancer drug candidate put the strength of its development
pipeline in doubt. Legal claims that heartburn drug Zantac
caused cancer have also weighed on the stock.Analysts have said that this year's expected market debut of
two new products, to balance out reliance on Dupixent, would be
important tests of the company's marketing prowess and a chance
to regain investor confidence.These products are haemophilia A treatment Altuviiio,
requiring fewer injections than standard therapy, and Beyfortus
from a partnership with AstraZeneca, which is a
preventive once-a-year shot against the common RSV airways
infection in infants.But for this year, marketing and sales expenses to boost
those launches would drag earnings lower, finance chief
Jean-Baptiste de Chatillon said in a media briefing.'HOME-GROWN INNOVATION'Chief Executive Paul Hudson pushed back when asked in a
press conference whether Sanofi was too dependant on Dupixent."When you don’t have a mega-blockbuster people say: don’t
you need a mega-blockbuster to be a success?" he said, adding
the intellectual property on the product with multiple uses was
protected beyond 2031."We understand the requirement to be ready for the 2030s and
beyond and we’d like to see more of our own home-grown
innovation accelerate," said Hudson. But he added that three to
five drug candidates with peak annual sales potential above 1
billion euros were in the pipeline over the next six years.Sanofi reported a 20.7% rise in fourth-quarter business
operating income, or adjusted earnings before interest and tax,
to 2.72 billion euros ($2.96 billion), edging past an average
analyst estimate of 2.69 billion euros posted on the company's
website.Revenue from Dupixent surged 42% to 2.4 billion euros during
the quarter ended Dec. 31, slightly above a consensus of 2.37
billion euros.The French drugmaker has forecast that Dupixent would
generate up to 13 billion euros in sales in its best year as it
seeks to widen its use across a number of inflammatory
conditions.Investors are expecting even more on average, partly on
hopes that the injection will also succeed in a trial on
smoker's lung, or COPD, a common disease that the company has so
far excluded from its sales target."The Altuviiio launch is expected to be relatively strong
but the market overall will for now wait for as-yet uncertain
COPD trial data on Dupixent," said mutual fund manager Manns.Analysts expect the study result to be published during the
first half.
