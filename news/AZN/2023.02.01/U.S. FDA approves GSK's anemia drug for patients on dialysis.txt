Feb 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) on Wednesday approved GSK Plc's drug as the first
oral treatment for anemia caused by chronic kidney disease in
adults who have been on dialysis for at least four months.The drug Jesduvroq comes with the boxed warning for
increased thrombotic vascular events, including death, heart
attack, stroke, and blood clots in the lungs, legs, or dialysis
access site. The warnings and precautions also include a risk of
hospitalization for heart failure, worsening increase of blood
pressure, stomach erosions, and gastrointestinal bleeding.The treatment is not approved for patients who are not on
dialysis because its safety has not been established in that
population, the FDA said.The approval makes it GSK's first since the company spun-off
its consumer health business — home to Sensodyne toothpaste and
Advil pain killers — last year.The health agency's decision also comes after its advisory
committee recommended the treatment for some kidney patients in
October.The wholesale acquisition cost has not yet been set for
Jesduvroq, GSK told Reuters. "As 87% of dialysis patients are on
Medicare, we are in the process of submitting the required
documentation with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
(CMS) to help ensure timely reimbursement and patient access to
Jesduvroq."This is the first drug in the HIF-PH inhibitor class to win
U.S. FDA approval, as similar drugs developed by FibroGen
and AstraZeneca, and Akebia Therapeutics
have failed to secure the regulator's nod earlier.HIF-PH inhibitors are a class of oral drugs designed to
boost production of red blood cells by mimicking the body's
response at high altitudes, where a lack of oxygen leads to
increase in red cell numbers and hemoglobin concentration.
