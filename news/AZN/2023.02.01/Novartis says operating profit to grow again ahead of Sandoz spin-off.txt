*FY operating income flat, slightly below expectations*Co on track to spin off generic business Sandoz in H2*Market pinning hopes on breast cancer, blood disorder
therapies*Shares fall on 'disappointing' Sandoz outlookBASEL, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Novartis on Wednesday
predicted that core operating income would grow in a "mid single
digit" percentage range in 2023 following stagnation last year,
as the Swiss drugmaker prepares to spin off its Sandoz generics
business.Full-year core operating income was broadly flat at $16.7
billion, it said in a statement, coming in slightly below market
expectations of $16.8 billion.Adjusted for overall negative currency effects, group sales
in 2022 advanced 4% to $50.5 billion as gains from heart failure
drug Entresto and multiple sclerosis (MS) drug Kesimpta were
partly offset by competition from cheap generic copies of
established MS drug Gilenya.Novartis said it was on track to spin off its generics unit
Sandoz in the second half of the year as part of its effort to
sharpen its focus on its patented prescription medicines.Analysts have welcomed a program unveiled in 2022 to trim
costs and cut 8,000 jobs and plans to focus on fewer therapy
areas and drug technologies. But the market has been
underwhelmed by prospects for medium-term growth from new drugs.Novartis shares were down 1.3% in early trade on
Wednesday and have fallen about 11% since January 2020,
underperforming most rivals.Credit Suisse analysts said that best-selling psoriasis
and arthritis drug Cosentyx fell short of estimates as the
company cited retroactive price cuts under the U.S. Medicaid
program for low-income households.They were also disappointed by guidance for Sandoz's
core operating income to decline by a "low double digit"
percentage in 2023 due to cost inflation and investments to make
it a stand-alone entity.The market has been pinning hopes for future sales growth on
wider use of breast cancer drug Kisqali and iptacopan, which is
being tested against a rare genetic blood disorder, possibly
challenging AstraZeneca's drugs Soliris and Ultomiris.MS drug Kesimpta, which requires fewer injections than
standard therapies, is expected to become Novartis' second
largest growth driver in 2023, after Entresto.(Reporting by Ludwig Burger; editing by Josephine Mason and
