Stomach cancer can spread to the: liver, lungs, lymph nodes, and tissue lining the abdominal cavity (peritoneum). The symptoms of advanced stomach cancer depend on what part of the body the cancer has spread to. The most common symptoms of stomach cancer include: unexplained weight loss, feeling and being sick, stomach pain, difficulty swallowing, and feeling tired. Advanced stage means your stomach cancer has spread. External radiotherapy can help to control your cancer and reduce symptoms.Advanced Gastric Carcinoma Emerging Drugs Profile*Camrelizumab: Jiangsu Hengrui MedicineCamrelizumab (formerly known as HR 301210, INCSHR 1210, SHR 1210) is a humanised high-affinity IgG4-kappa monoclonal antibody that targets the programmed cell death-1 receptor. Currently, it is in Phase III stage of clinical trial evaluation to treat advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.*Pamiparib: BeiGenePamiparib (BGB-290) is an investigational small molecule inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2. Pamiparib is being evaluated as a monotherapy in pivotal clinical trials in China in recurrent platinum-sensitive and BRCA1/2 mutated ovarian cancers. It is currently in global clinical development as a monotherapy, and in combination with other agents, including BeiGene's investigational anti-PD1 antibody, tislelizumab (BGB-A317), for a variety of solid tumor malignancies.For further information, refer to the detailed Advanced Gastric Carcinoma Drugs Launch, Advanced Gastric Carcinoma Developmental Activities, and Advanced Gastric Carcinoma News, click here for Advanced Gastric Carcinoma Ongoing Clinical Trial AnalysisAdvanced Gastric Carcinoma Pipeline Therapeutics AssessmentThere are approx. 50+ key companies which are developing the therapies for Advanced Gastric Carcinoma.
