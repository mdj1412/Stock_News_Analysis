Sawan told the newspaper that the UK government should look to the US's recent actions, such as the 'inflation reduction act', which gives a USD369 billion subsidy package to encourage domestic green investment. Sawan said he would "think twice" about further oil investment in the UK, citing "more attractive" propositions, such as the US Gulf of Mexico. Recent developments in the UK such as ad-hoc interventions, delays to planning, and a lack of clarity over subsidies are likely to hinder Shell's goal to invest GBP25 billion in the UK over the next decade, he said. ----------AstraZeneca noted positive high-level results from an analysis of the ongoing Destiny-PanTumor02 phase II trial for Enhertu.
