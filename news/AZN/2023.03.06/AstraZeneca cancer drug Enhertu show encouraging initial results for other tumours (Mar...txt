March 6 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca said on Monday a
mid-stage trial of its cancer drug Enhertu, co-developed with
Daiichi Sankyo,  showed positive results across
multiple HER2-expressing advanced solid tumours in heavily
pre-treated patients.The ongoing DESTINY-PanTumor02 Phase II trial is assessing
the efficacy and safety of Enhertu in patients with locally
advanced or metastatic previously treated solid tumours that are
not eligible for curative therapy, including cervical, ovarian,
pancreatic, and rare cancers."Enhertu has already demonstrated its potential to improve
outcomes for patients with HER2-targetable breast, gastric and
lung cancers, and these positive initial results in other tumour
settings with significant unmet need are very encouraging,"
Cristian Massacesi, AstraZeneca's chief medical officer and
oncology chief development officer, said in a statement.
