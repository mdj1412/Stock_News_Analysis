(Alliance News) - AstraZeneca PLC on Friday said Tezspire has been approved for self-administration in the EU in a new pre-filled pen, for severe asthma patients aged 12 years and older.The Cambridge-based pharmaceutical company said Tezspire, whose generic name is tezepelumab, received a positive opinion from the European Medicine Agencyâ€™s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for self-administration in a pre-filled, single-use pen."The CHMP opinion can be implemented without the need for a European Commission decision due to the nature of the Type-II label variation," Astra said.The approval was based on results from the Pathfinder clinical trial programme. "The improvements in asthma control and the safety profile of Tezspire observed in the Path-home trial were consistent with previous clinical trials," the company says. Executive Vice President Mene Pangalos of AstraZeneca said: "Tezspire is the first and only biologic approved in Europe for patients with severe asthma with no phenotype or biomarker limitation. With the approval of the Tezspire pre-filled pen, we can give patients in Europe greater flexibility and support physicians in treating a broad population of severe asthma patients."AstraZeneca said it expects a regulatory decision by the US Food & Drug Administration on self-administration and the new pre-filled pen in the first half of 2023.Tezspire is currently approved for the treatment of severe asthma in the US, EU, Japan and other countries.Shares were up 1.7% at 11,642.00 pence each on Friday morning in London.
