The Company is building on the work already done in blood cancers where chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies, a type of living medicine created by isolating and modifying a patient's T cells to target their specific tumour, are being used to treat some haematological malignancies. Their research teams are exploring new ways to target and arm CAR-Ts to increase their effectiveness in solid tumours by overcoming the immune-suppressive tumour microenvironment. Looking to the future, AstraZeneca is working to engineer next-generation cell therapies, where physicians could potentially select from a library of off-the-shelf patient-ready therapies already developed from the cells of healthy donors.Ultimately, by utilising innovative strategies to improve the precision and effectiveness of cell therapies, the Company's goal is to deliver new medicines to help transform the lives of patients living with a range of cancers.AstraZeneca in oncologyAstraZeneca is leading a revolution in oncology with the ambition to provide cures for cancer in every form, following the science to understand cancer and all its complexities to discover, develop and deliver life-changing medicines to patients.The Company's focus is on some of the most challenging cancers.
