The Consumer Price Index (CPI) inched down 0.1% between November and December, which is what the Bloomberg consensus expected. The Core CPI, , which excludes volatile energy and food prices, gained 0.3% over the same period, also in line with expectations.

The December consumer-price index gained 6.5% year-over-year, after rising 7.1% in November, while the core CPI was up 5.7% after a 6% rise a month earlier.
However, US weekly jobless claims came in at 205,000 last week, lower that the 215,000 expected, signaling that the job market remains tight.
Investors clearly don't know what to think of this data, which perhaps was not as good as they hoped. They need to see the beginning of something positive for equity markets, and forget about 2022. U.S. indices looked shaky yesterday before ending at the day's high. The Nasdaq 100, a natural marker of risk appetite, was on its fourth consecutive session of gains after a 1.76% gain yesterday. It passed the 11,400-point mark, returning to its mid-December levels.
The big hope is that the US central bank won its fight against inflation, which should allow it to normalize its monetary policy in the foreseeable future. Recession fears and the second-round effects of higher policy rates have now taken a step back. While there was little doubt that price inflation will continue to slow, the proportion matters. The latest figures have been more favorable than the market had expected on average, but today's were in line with expectations…This explains the mixed reaction.
