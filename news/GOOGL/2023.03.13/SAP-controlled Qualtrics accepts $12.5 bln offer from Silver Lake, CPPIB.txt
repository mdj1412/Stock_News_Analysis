said on Monday it would be taken private after its controlling
shareholder, SAP SE, accepted a $12.5 billion bid from
a consortium led by Silver Lake and Canada Pension Plan
Investment Board (CPPIB).Shares of the customer survey software maker rose more than
6% to $17.60 before the bell.SAP agreed to the $18.15-per-share offer and said it would
get about $7.7 billion for its stake.The year's biggest private equity-led buyout comes after the
German software giant decided that the offer was the best it
could secure, Reuters reported on Sunday.Qualtrics said earlier this month it would negotiate on an
exclusive basis with Silver Lake and CPPIB until March 15 to see
whether a deal could be finalized.Silver Lake, whose portfolio consists mostly of technology
companies, currently holds a 4.1% stake in Qualtrics.In 2018, SAP bought Qualtrics for $8 billion and three years
later listed it in New York.Videogame software developer Unity Software and
Alphabet Inc's self-driving technology firm Waymo are
among the companies in Silver Lake's portfolio.
