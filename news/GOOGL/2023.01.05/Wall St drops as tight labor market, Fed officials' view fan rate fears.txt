sharply on Thursday as fresh evidence of a tight labor market
and hawkish comments from policymakers deepened fears of
elevated interest rates for longer than expected.The ADP National Employment report showed a
higher-than-expected rise in private employment in December,
while another report showed weekly jobless claims fell last
week.The reports came a day after data showed a moderate fall in
U.S. job openings, in growing evidence that the labor market
remains tight.Most big technology and growth stocks such as Alphabet Inc
and Microsoft Corp fell between 1.0% and 2.3%
as U.S. Treasury yields surged on prolonged rate-hike
expectations.On the benchmark S&P 500 index, rate-sensitive real estate
stocks led the losses with a 2.9% drop, with utilities
in tow and down 2.1%.A strong labor market has been a concern for markets
pummeled by fears of a recession from rising rates as it gives
the Federal Reserve a reason to keep tightening financial
conditions for longer than expected this year."Everything else within the economy appears to be moderating
except labor market demand, which is the key to the Fed stopping
rate hikes," said Brent Schutte, chief investment officer of
Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co.In the previous session, Wall Street's main indexes erased
some of their gains after minutes from the Fed's December
meeting showed the central bank was laser-focused on fighting
inflation even as officials agreed to slow the pace of rate
hikes to limit risks to economic growth.Both Kansas City Fed leader Esther George and Atlanta
President Raphael Bostic on Thursday stressed the central bank's
priority to curb stubborn price pressures through policy
tightening.Traders were almost evenly split on chances of a 25-basis
point and a 50-bps rate hike in February and now see rates
peaking at slightly above 5% in June.The more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls report is due on
Friday, which would provide further clues on labor demand and
the rate hike trajectory.At 12:05 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
was down 382.59 points, or 1.15%, at 32,887.18, the S&P 500
was down 41.92 points, or 1.09%, at 3,811.05, and the
Nasdaq Composite was down 116.55 points, or 1.11%, at
10,342.22.Among individual stocks, Tesla Inc dropped 3.3%
after December sales of its China-made electric vehicles fell to
a five-month low, while Amazon.com Inc, which announced
increased layoff plans, reversed premarket gains.Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc dropped 7.5% after the
drugstore chain posted a quarterly loss on an opioid litigation
charge.Bed Bath & Beyond Inc lost 24.9% after the company
said it was exploring options, including a bankruptcy filing.Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.48-to-1 ratio
on the NYSE and a 1.84-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The S&P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and six new
lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 35 new highs and 54 new lows.
