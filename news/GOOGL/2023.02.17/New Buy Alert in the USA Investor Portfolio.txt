Today we sold Alphabet Inc and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation in the USA Investor portfolio with respective capital gains of 94.18% and -8.77%. The aim of this arbitration is to reduce our portfolio's exposure to technology stocks by 30 to 25%.
Related to Alphabet Inc, in addition to disappointing publications and downward revisions, we are concerned that the short-term pressures that the American firm is undergoing in areas such as AI will persist for some time. This will undermine the price appreciation potential and the momentum of the stock. The recent publications of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation are also at the origin of our decision to separate ourselves from this stock. The downward revisions suggest to us that there are currently better alternatives in the market. In addition, the SuperformanceÂ® ratings have deteriorated, particularly in terms of momentum.
Alphabet Inc. and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation were replaced by Lamb Weston Holdings Inc. and Super Micro Computer Inc. These two U.S. stocks, a frozen potato products trader and a server and storage systems platform distributor, respectively, joined our portfolio on the basis of two strong fundamentals. In addition to good momentum, these stocks boast strong margins and high returns on capital.
