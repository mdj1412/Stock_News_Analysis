More than twice as many patients on Dupixent achieved clear or almost clear skin compared to placebo at 16 weeksNearly four times as many patients on Dupixent saw a clinically meaningful reduction of itch, with improvements seen as early as one week TARRYTOWN, N.Y. and PARIS, March  18, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today presented positive results from the clinical trial assessing Dupixent® (dupilumab) in adults and adolescents with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic hand and foot dermatitis. The trial, the first evaluating a biologic for this difficult-to-treat population, met its primary and key secondary endpoints. The results were featured in a late-breaking session, one of more than 20 Dupixent scientific presentations, at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) 2023 Annual Meeting.“Atopic hand and foot dermatitis can extensively disrupt the lives of patients, given the intense itch and painful skin lesions it causes on essential body areas,” said Eric L. Simpson, M.D., Frances J. Storrs Professor of Medical Dermatology at the Oregon Health and Science University and principal investigator of this trial. “In this trial, Dupixent significantly improved disease signs, symptoms and quality of life measures for this particularly difficult-to-treat subset of atopic dermatitis patients, with itch improvement seen as early as one week after the first dose. While the efficacy and safety profile of Dupixent is well-established for atopic dermatitis more broadly, these positive results are the first demonstrating the impact on specific and heavily used areas of the body.”In the trial, patients received Dupixent (n=67) every two weeks (adults 300 mg, adolescents 200 mg or 300 mg based on body weight) or placebo (n=66). At 16 weeks, patients treated with Dupixent experienced the following:The trial demonstrated similar safety results to the known safety profile of Dupixent in atopic dermatitis. Overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 66% for Dupixent and 74% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) compared to placebo included nasopharyngitis (16% Dupixent, 11% placebo), upper respiratory tract infection (9% Dupixent, 5% placebo), conjunctivitis (6% Dupixent, 2% placebo), herpes viral infections (6% Dupixent, 3% placebo) and increased blood creatine phosphokinase (6% Dupixent, 0% placebo). Additionally, 3% of patients taking Dupixent used at least one rescue medication compared to 21% of patients on placebo.There are 23 Dupixent scientific abstracts being presented across three dermatological diseases with underlying type 2 inflammation at the AAD 2023 Annual Meeting. These include oral presentations on long-term Dupixent use in children as young as 6 months with atopic dermatitis; the impact of Dupixent treatment on health-related quality of life, skin pain and sleep in prurigo nodularis; and the investigational use of Dupixent on signs, symptoms and health-related quality of life in chronic spontaneous urticaria.The potential use of Dupixent in chronic spontaneous urticaria is currently under clinical development, and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the Dupixent TrialThe Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 133 adolescents and adults with moderate-to-severe atopic hand and foot dermatitis who had an inadequate response or intolerance to topical corticosteroids. Patients with hand and foot disease predominantly driven by allergic or irritant contact dermatitis were excluded from the trial.The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin of hand and feet eczema at 16 weeks (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator Global Assessment Scale). The key secondary endpoint measured the proportion of patients with improvement in itch on hands and feet from baseline (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Peak-Pruritis Numeric Rating Scale [PP-NRS] on a 0-10 scale) at 16 weeks. Lesion sign reduction was assessed by change from baseline in Modified Total Lesion Sign Score (mTLSS; measured by a 0-36 scale), and disease severity was assessed by the change from baseline in Hand Eczema Severity Index (HECSI) score (measured by a 0-360 scale). Symptoms were assessed every one or two weeks during the trial.Additional secondary endpoints included:About DupixentDupixent, which was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, CRSwNP, EoE or prurigo nodularis, in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries, including in the U.S., European Union and Japan. More than 600,000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron’s VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent, Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials, including pediatric EoE, chronic inducible urticaria-cold, chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic pruritus of unknown origin, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONDo not use if you are allergic to dupilumab or to any of the ingredients in DUPIXENT®.Before using DUPIXENT, tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions, including if you:Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the- counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.Especially tell your healthcare provider if you are taking oral, topical, or inhaled corticosteroid medicines; have asthma and use an asthma medicine; or have atopic dermatitis, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, eosinophilic esophagitis, or prurigo nodularis and also have asthma. Do not change or stop your corticosteroid medicine or other asthma medicine without talking to your healthcare provider.
