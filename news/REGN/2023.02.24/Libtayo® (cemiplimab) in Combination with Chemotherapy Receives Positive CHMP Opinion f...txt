TARRYTOWN, N.Y., Feb.  24, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion for Libtayo® (cemiplimab) in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy. Specifically, the CHMP recommended the Libtayo combination be approved in the European Union (EU) for first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with ≥1% PD-L1 expression. This includes patients that have no EGFR, ALK or ROS1 aberrations and whose tumors are metastatic or locally advanced and not candidates for definitive chemoradiation.The European Commission is expected to make a final decision on the application in the coming months. In November 2022, the Libtayo combination was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for advanced NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression.The positive opinion is supported by results from the global Phase 3 EMPOWER-Lung 3 trial, which was designed to closely resemble a patient population with varied disease presentations that physicians manage in everyday clinical practice. At the primary analysis with a median follow-up of 16 months, the trial showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) for patients treated with the Libtayo combination (n=312) compared to chemotherapy alone (n=154) in the overall population (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.53 to 0.93).Among the 466 patients enrolled in the trial, 70% of patients (n=327) had tumors expressing PD-L1 ≥1%. Comparing the Libtayo combination (n=217) to chemotherapy alone (n=110), efficacy results in this population showed a:Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue during or after treatment with Libtayo. Among those measured for safety in the trial (n=465), adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients included anemia (44%), alopecia (37%), musculoskeletal pain (27%), nausea (25%), fatigue (23%), peripheral neuropathy (21%), hyperglycemia (18%), decreased appetite (17%), alanine aminotransferase increased (16%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (15%), neutropenia (15%), constipation (14%), dyspnoea (13%), rash (13%), thrombocytopenia (13%), vomiting (12%), diarrhea (11%), insomnia (11%), weight decreased (11%) and hypoalbuminemia (10%). Adverse events were serious in 25% of patients and led to permanent discontinuation of Libtayo in 5% of patients.Libtayo is currently approved in the EU and other countries for the treatment of certain patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC), advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), advanced NSCLC and advanced cervical cancer.About the Phase 3 TrialEMPOWER-Lung 3 was a randomized, multicenter Phase 3 trial investigating Libtayo in combination with a physician’s choice of platinum-doublet chemotherapy, compared to platinum-doublet chemotherapy alone. The trial enrolled 466 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, as well as squamous or non-squamous histologies across all PD-L1 expression levels and with no ALK, EGFR or ROS1 aberrations.Among those enrolled, 43% had tumors with squamous histology, 15% had locally advanced disease, and 7% had a history of brain metastases. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either Libtayo or placebo, plus histology-specific platinum-doublet chemotherapy. The trial was stopped early based on a recommendation by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) after the Libtayo and chemotherapy combination demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival, the primary endpoint. Results of the trial at the primary endpoint were published in Nature Medicine in August 2022.In December 2022, Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy was added to the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (score: 4 out of 5), for patients with advanced NSCLC across squamous and non-squamous histologies, and irrespective of PD-1 expression levels.About NSCLCLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In recent years, more than 2.2 million annual new cases have been diagnosed globally. Approximately 84% of all lung cancers are NSCLC, with 75% of these cases diagnosed in advanced stages. Additionally, 70% of all NSCLC cases will have <50% PD-L1 expression, making it the most common treatment setting.About Regeneron in OncologyAt Regeneron, we’re applying more than three decades of scientific innovation with the goal of developing paradigm-changing therapies for patients with cancer. Our oncology portfolio is built around two foundational approaches – our approved PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo and investigational bispecific antibodies – which are being evaluated both as monotherapies and in combination with emerging therapeutic modalities. Together, they provide us with unique combinatorial flexibility to develop potentially synergistic treatments for a wide range of solid tumors and blood cancers.If you are interested in learning more about our clinical trials, please contact us (clinicaltrials@regeneron.com or 844-734-6643) or visit our clinical trials website.About LibtayoLibtayo is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 on T cells and was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology. By binding to PD-1, Libtayo has been shown to block cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation. In the U.S. and other countries, Libtayo is indicated in certain patients with advanced BCC, advanced CSCC and advanced NSCLC, as well as in advanced cervical cancer in the EU, Canada and Brazil. As of July 1, 2022, Regeneron is responsible for the development and marketing of Libtayo globally.In the U.S., the generic name for Libtayo in its approved indications is cemiplimab-rwlc, with rwlc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the FDA. Outside of the U.S. the generic name of Libtayo in its approved indication is cemiplimab.The extensive clinical program for Libtayo is focused on difficult-to-treat cancers. Libtayo is currently being investigated in trials as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with either conventional or novel therapeutic approaches for other solid tumors and blood cancers. These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. FDA-approved IndicationsLibtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat:It is not known if Libtayo is safe and effective in children.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR U.S. PATIENTSWhat is the most important information I should know about Libtayo?Libtayo is a medicine that may treat certain cancers by working with your immune system.
