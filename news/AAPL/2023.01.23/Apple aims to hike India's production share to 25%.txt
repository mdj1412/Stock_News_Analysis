That's according to India's trade minister on Monday (January 23).However, he did not say when Apple wants to meet the target.And the tech firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Apple has bet big on India since the country began iPhone assembly there in 2017, in line with the government's push for local manufacturing.Last year, sources told Reuters that manufacturer Foxconn plans to quadruple the workforce at its iPhone factory in India over two years.The country's electronics minister tweeted on Monday that Apple's exports from India had hit $1 billion in December.The shift comes as the iPhone maker continues to move its manufacturing away from China, due to the country's lockdown restrictions and rising tensions between Washington and Beijing.
