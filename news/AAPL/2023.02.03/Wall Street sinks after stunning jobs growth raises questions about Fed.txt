slump*Ford Motor drops on downbeat outlook*Indexes down: Dow 0.39%, S&P 0.91%, Nasdaq 1.25%(Updates with mid-afternoon trading)Feb 3 (Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes fell in
choppy trading on Friday after surprisingly strong jobs data
sparked concerns about aggressive Federal Reserve action, while
investors digested a mixed bag of megacap company earnings
reports.The S&P 500 was still set to end the week with gains and was
not far from five-month highs, while the Nasdaq was on pace for
its fifth straight weekly rise.U.S. job growth accelerated sharply in January, with nonfarm
payrolls surging by 517,000 jobs, well above an estimate of
185,000. The unemployment rate hit a more than 53-1/2-year low
of 3.4%.In another sign of economic strength, U.S. services industry
activity rebounded strongly in January.Investors have been balancing hopeful signs that the economy
could avoid a feared recession against concerns about how long
the Fed will keep interest rates high to rein in inflation. The
S&P 500 gained earlier this week after more dovish-than-expected
comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who acknowledged progress
in the fight against inflation.The jobs report "was an incredible surprise and it raises a
lot of questions about what the Fed is going to do next,” said
Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco.
“What I think is causing some of the volatility is markets
trying to make sense of how the Fed will perceive this.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 132.16 points,
or 0.39%, to 33,921.78, the S&P 500 lost 37.88 points, or
0.91%, to 4,141.88 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped
152.08 points, or 1.25%, to 12,048.74.Wall Street's main indexes have had a solid start to the
year as tech and other stocks that struggled last year have
rebounded, fueled by hopes that the Fed's rate hikes would soon
end and the economy might be able to navigate a soft landing.On Friday, investors were also digesting another heavy
batch of corporate results.Shares of Apple, the largest U.S. company by market
value, were up 3%. The company forecast that revenue would fall
for a second quarter in a row but that iPhone sales were likely
to improve as production had returned to normal in China.Shares of Amazon slumped more than 7% as the
company said operating profit could fall to zero in the current
quarter as savings from layoffs do not make up for the financial
impact of consumers and cloud customers clamping down on
spending.Alphabet shares shed over 2% after the Google
parent posted fourth-quarter profit and sales short of Wall
Street expectations.In other corporate news, Ford Motor shares slid over
7% after the automaker predicted a difficult year ahead.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a
2.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.55-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and one new low; the
Nasdaq Composite recorded 103 new highs and 10 new lows.
