After last week’s big selloff on renewed rate hike fears, investors looked for bargains yesterday and it seems like today might be the same, with the main three Wall Street indices slightly up in pre-market trading.
After Friday’s stronger-than-expected PCE data, investors have started to consider the possibility of a 50 bps rate hike in March, instead of 25, with the odds at about 25%, according to the CME FedWatch tool.  Fed fund futures sees rates peaking at 5.4% by September, up from 4.57% now.

BofA Global Research even believes the Fed may hike interest rates to nearly 6%: "Aggregate demand needs to weaken significantly for inflation to return to the Fed's target. Further supply-chain normalization and a slowdown in the labor market will help, but only to a degree," said BofA in a note. "Moreover, these processes are taking longer than we and markets were expecting."
Yesterday, the session started well but ended lower. The Nasdaq 100 still held on to 0.7% gains, but the S&P500 and the Dow Jones were limited to 0.2 / 0.3%. This did not prevent Elon Musk from regaining his place as the richest man in the world in the Bloomberg ranking of billionaires. He is credited with $187 billion compared to $185 billion for LVMH head Bernard Arnault. The ranking changes with the rise and fall of LVMH and Tesla, as the competition is left behind: that big loser Jeff Bezos only reaches $117 billion. But enough of the billionaire's ramblings. Wall Street has had a little trouble keeping up, even if the appetite for risky assets has recovered a little. In Europe, the good behavior of indices was also favored by the announcement of a Northern Ireland trading deal between the EU and the UK.
Behind the rise in equity markets, the backdrop has not changed much. U.S. bond yields are still being stretched by uncertainty about the path of rates. All in all, the two statistics released yesterday did not do much to advance the debate. Housing data was surprisingly strong, while the durable goods orders numbers faltered. Experts are still struggling to quantify the impact of the "January effect" on these data. Investors will be closely looking at the Conference Board's U.S. Consumer Confidence Index, released at 10:00 am ET today. There will also be real estate prices and activity indexes.
 
Economic highlights of the day:
France and Spain’s February inflation figures, wholesale inventories, the FHFA house price index, the Chicago PMI,  the Conference Board's consumer confidence index and the Richmond Fed's index are today’s main events. All the agenda is here. This morning, Japan reported a sharper than expected contraction in industrial production of -4.6% in January.
The dollar is flat against the euro at EUR 0.9419 and down 0.4% against the pound at GBP 0.8255. The ounce of gold is down slightly to 1809 dollars. Oil remains firm, with North Sea Brent at USD 83.73 per barrel and U.S. WTI light crude at USD 77.60. The yield on 10-year US debt loses a point to 3.93%. Bitcoin is trading around 23,400 dollars.
