        Today Apple and Major League Baseball (MLB) announced that "Friday Night Baseball," a weekly doubleheader, will be available to all Apple TV+ subscribers on Fridays throughout the regular season. Fans in 60 countries and regions can enjoy two marquee matchups over 25 weeks with no local broadcast restrictions. "Friday Night Baseball" will begin the 2023 season on Friday, April 7, with the Texas Rangers at the Chicago Cubs for the inaugural "Friday Night Baseball" daytime game at Chicago's Wrigley Field, and the San Diego Padres at the Atlanta Braves. Apple and MLB also announced the "Friday Night Baseball" schedule for the first half of the season, through June 30.
      

        "We can't wait for 'Friday Night Baseball' to start up again, and we're excited for fans to experience everything new we're bringing this season," said Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Services. "Apple TV+ truly has something for everyone, from two live baseball games every Friday night, to an incredible slate of award-winning original films and series - there's never been a better time to sign up."
      

        This season, "Friday Night Baseball" welcomes an exceptional group of broadcast talent to the announcer booths, including Wayne Randazzo (play-by-play), Dontrelle Willis (analyst), Heidi Watney (sideline reporter), Alex Faust (play-by-play), Ryan Spilborghs (analyst), and Tricia Whitaker (sideline reporter). Game assignments for announcers will be shared on a weekly basis.
      

        Live pre- and postgame coverage will again be hosted by Lauren Gardner, along with Siera Santos. Former MLB players Xavier Scruggs and Matt Joyce will serve as analysts alongside baseball journalist Russell Dorsey. Brian Gorman and Dale Scott - both former MLB umpires - will join to break down MLB's new rules for the season.
      

        "Friday Night Baseball" will be produced by MLB Network's Emmy Award-winning production team in partnership with Apple, bringing viewers an unparalleled viewing experience. Each game will feature state-of-the-art cameras to present vivid live-action shots, and offer immersive sound in 5.1 with Spatial Audio enabled. "Friday Night Baseball" will again utilize drone cameras for beautiful aerial stadium shots, as well as player mics and field-level mics to immerse fans in the gameplay and stadium atmosphere. Fans in the U.S. and Canada1 will also have the option to listen to the audio of the home and away teams' local radio broadcasts during "Friday Night Baseball" games.
      

        Beginning MLB Opening Day on March 30, fans in the U.S. and Canada can enjoy the MLB Big Inning whip-around show featuring live look-ins and in-game highlights every weeknight, and beginning in April, a full slate of MLB-related content including Countdown to First Pitch, MLB Daily Recap, and MLB This Week on Apple TV+. Fans can also access additional MLB programming for free in the Apple TV app, including "Friday Night Baseball" condensed game recaps after the completion of the live broadcasts each week; classic games; highlights and interviews; and more.2
