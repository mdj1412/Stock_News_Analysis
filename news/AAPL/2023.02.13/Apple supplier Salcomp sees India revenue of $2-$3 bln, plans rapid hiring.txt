CHENNAI, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Finland's Salcomp, a
supplier to Apple, plans to double its workforce in
India to 25,000 over the next three years, targeting annual
revenue in the country of at least $2 billion to $3 billion by
2025, a top company executive said on Monday.The plans come as Apple shifts production away from China
after its strict COVID-related lockdowns and restrictions, and
with rising trade and geopolitical tensions between Beijing and
Washington."The whole supply chain is now kind of looking at an
alternative. And India is poised to be one of the best
alternatives," Sasikumar Gendham, managing director, Salcomp
Manufacturing India, told reporters in Chennai city in southern
India during an industry event."Everyone knows that the whole world has been depending on
this one nation (China) over the last few decades and it's time
to really diversify and decluster," he added.Cupertino, California-based Apple has bet big on India since
it began iPhone assembly in the country in 2017 via Wistron
and later Foxconn, in line with the Indian
government's push for local manufacturing.Gendham told Reuters that Salcomp will have a "significant
role" in Apple's supply chain.Salcomp currently employs about 12,000 at its Chennai plant,
where it makes mostly chargers, but also other smartphone parts.It started the Chennai operation in 2020 having reached an
agreement a year earlier to take over the facility formerly
owned by Finnish telecom equipment maker Nokia.Gendham said he expects the India business to generate at
least $2 billion-$3 billion in revenue by 2025, from less than
40 billion rupees ($484 million) now.Foxconn is also planning to quadruple the
workforce at its iPhone factory in India over two years, Reuters
reported last year.J.P.Morgan analysts estimated last year that a quarter of
all Apple products would be made outside China by 2025, from 5%
currently. Apple wants India to account for up to 25% of its
production from about 5%-7% now, the country's trade minister
said in January.Salcomp also said it is setting up a housing complex with
entertainment and education facilities for about 15,000 people.
