Universal Remote Codes confirmed that Apple Inc. announced today the release of its newest Apple Watch models for 2023.

"We're thrilled to be introducing our newest Apple Watch models for 2023," said Tim Cook, CEO of Apple. "These watches are packed with advanced features and are designed to help users stay healthy and active, while also keeping them connected to the people and information they care about most."
