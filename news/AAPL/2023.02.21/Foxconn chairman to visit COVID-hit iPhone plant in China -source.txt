TAIPEI, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Foxconn Chairman Liu
Young-way departed on Tuesday for a four-day inspection of the
company's iPhone plant in Zhengzhou, China, a source with direct
knowledge of the matter said.This will be Liu's first visit to the world's largest Apple
iPhone factory in his role as chairman, and his main
goals are to review conditions after the resumption of
production and to extensively exchange views, the source said.Liu is scheduled to meet with senior government officials
including Lou Yangsheng, the Communist Party chief of Henan
province where Zhengzhou is located, the source said.Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision
Industry Co, declined to comment. The Henan government did not
immediately respond to a request for comment.The source briefed on the matter declined to be identified
as they were not authorised to speak to the media.The Taiwanese company's iPhone plant was hit late last year
by a COVID-19 outbreak that prompted thousands of worker
departures and unrest, as well as production disruptions.In January, Foxconn said output at its Zhengzhou plant had
"basically returned to normal."
