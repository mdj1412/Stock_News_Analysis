Winter is well underway, but where is the snow?"...to walk through Central Park today, it's glorious."New York City has gone 320 consecutive days without snowfall, according to the national weather service.And if it can go until Sunday - it will set a record for the latest winter snow in the Big Apple since January 29, 1973."I think we need to look back at the historical record of snowfall to get a better sense of really how rare this is"Andrew Kruczkiewicz is with Columbia University's Climate School and International Research Institute for Climate and Society. He told Reuters a warming climate combined with natural swings in weather might explain the balmy winter."It's a combination of rising temperatures related to climate change and also natural variability that happens. I actually look back at the historical record of snowfall, specifically like decade by decade, and we do see these shifts, decade, decade by decade trends in snowfall. So, I think asking questions about the links to climate change, yes, we need to do that. We also need to look at natural variability and the role that plays."A New York City winter typically looks like this: thick white snow blanketing the sidewalks and water freezing in fountains.This year, the first 17 days of January were the 3rd warmest on record with an average temperature of 43.7 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the National Weather Service.While the city has seen a few light dustings and flurries, not enough has accumulated on the ground to meet the point one-inch threshold of what constitutes a snowfall.But even if the snow is late, that doesn't mean it won't arrive."It is definitely rare, but we have a lot of, we have a lot of winter left. You know, February is actually our snowiest month here in New York City, here in Central Park. So, it is important to keep in mind things could change very quickly."While January may be winding down, about two months of winter still remain.
