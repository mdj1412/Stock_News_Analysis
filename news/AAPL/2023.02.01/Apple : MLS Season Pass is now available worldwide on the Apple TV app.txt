        Starting today, fans can sign up for MLS Season Pass, the unprecedented subscription service now available on the Apple TV app in more than 100 countries and regions. To get ready for the 2023 Major League Soccer season, fans can enjoy a wide variety of free on-demand content that celebrates the action, excitement, and distinct culture of MLS, including content from MLS clubs, 2023 player profiles, the best league and club highlights from the 2022 season, full replays of classic matches, and documentary-style vignettes.
      

        Once the season kicks off on February 25, MLS Season Pass will feature every live MLS regular-season match, the entire Audi MLS Cup Playoffs, and Leagues Cup1 all in one place, with consistent match times and no blackouts - a first in live sports broadcasting.

        "Having accessibility is huge for the sport. It's going to help grow MLS not only domestically, but internationally. You'll have eyes all over watching our games," said Kellyn Acosta, Los Angeles Football Club's midfielder. "We talk about how we want the league to continue to grow and bridge the gap in comparison with other leagues, and I think having this Apple partnership is a step in the right direction. Leading into the World Cup in 2026, you want to build momentum and gain more exposure, and I think this partnership is going to truly be beautiful. I know my family is excited to have all the games in one place, and I think it's going to be huge for the league and for the sport in the US."
      

        "It never really crossed my mind that a partnership like this would really alleviate a lot of those stresses for so many of our fans, our families, our friends, and for the players too, because we watch MLS all the time," said Mark-Anthony Kaye, Toronto FC's midfielder. "So it's a good feeling to know that the league understands these issues and has done a really good job to put a deal together that can put us in a better position to bring MLS to the world. I've only been in the league for six years, but the amount of growth is mind-blowing. So I think this is only scratching the surface with this Apple deal, and I'm really happy that they've done it."
      

        Fans can visit mlssoccer.com/schedule to see the full 2023 MLS season schedule, including which matches are available for free on the Apple TV app during the first month. Additional free matches will be added regularly throughout the season.
