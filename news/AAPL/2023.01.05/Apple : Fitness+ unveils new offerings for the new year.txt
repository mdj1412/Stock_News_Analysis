      In January, Apple Fitness+ launches a slate of new offerings designed to help users stay active and mindful in the new year, including a new Kickboxing workout type.
    


        Apple Fitness+, the award-winning fitness and wellness service that is welcoming to all, is introducing new ways for users to improve their overall well-being in the new year. Starting Monday, January 9, the service will launch Kickboxing, a new total-body cardio workout type. A brand-new meditation theme, Sleep, will join the nine other themes in the Meditation library, all designed to make users' practice more impactful than ever before. To help them get started, a new program called Introduction to Meditations for Sleep - designed to help users wind down before bed and drift off to sleep - will launch.
      

        Additionally, Artist Spotlight will launch new workouts featuring music by Beyoncé, including songs from her latest album, RENAISSANCE, bringing her iconic music to the service. Time to Walk will kick off its fifth season with new guests, including Golden Globe-nominated actor Jamie Lee Curtis, late-night talk show host Amber Ruffin, Olympic champion figure skater Nathan Chen, and German actor Nina Hoss. Fitness+ will also launch two new Collections - 6 Weeks to Restart Your Fitness and Level Up Your Core Training - as well as welcome three new trainers to the team.
      

        "No matter where people are on their health and well-being journey, Fitness+ makes it easy to get started and stay motivated with workouts and meditations that are welcoming to all," said Jay Blahnik, Apple's vice president of Fitness Technologies. "Whether people want to boost their cardio with the newest workout type, Kickboxing; move to Beyoncé's latest hits; or wind down before bed with a meditation, there really is something for everyone to take care of their body and mind in the new year."
      

Kickboxing and New Trainers


        Kickboxing workouts can help build full-body fitness, and are a great way to build strength, stamina, coordination, and balance. Starting January 9, Fitness+ will add Kickboxing as a new total-body cardio workout type. Each workout will consist of a distinct round of moves followed by one final round, which will combine the moves users just learned into an all-out one-minute interval. No equipment is required, and workouts will be 10, 20, or 30 minutes long.
      

        Kickboxing will be led by two Fitness+ trainers. Jamie-Ray Hartshorne, who users know and love from Treadmill, HIIT, and Time to Run workouts, trained in muay thai and professionally competed in Thailand.

        Additionally, Nez Dally will join the trainer team to lead Kickboxing workouts. The muay thai fighter made history when she became the first woman to compete in Thailand wearing a hijab. In her workouts, she brings the drive of a high-achieving athlete to empower users with every jab, cross, and kick.
      

        In addition to Dally, two more new trainers will join the Fitness+ trainer team in January: Brian Cochrane for HIIT and Jenn Lau for Strength. Cochrane, who hails from Scotland, grew up playing a variety of sports, making his HIIT training a versatile practice. As a former singer in an indie band, he continues to be inspired by the way music and movement come together.
      

        Lau co-founded a gym in her hometown of Toronto, and she is just as passionate about inclusivity as she is about helping people stay active. She brings tenacity and playfulness to every lift and lunge she teaches.
