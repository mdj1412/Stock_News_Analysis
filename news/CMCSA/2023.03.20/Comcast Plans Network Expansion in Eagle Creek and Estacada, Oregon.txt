(via NewsDirect)Comcast is expanding the availability of high-speed Internet services in Eagle Creek and Estacada, Oregon. Comcast began construction of the infrastructure this month and expects to make a full suite of Internet and video services available to approximately 1,700 homes and businesses in 2023 with the potential to add more locations next year in these rural communities.Some homes and businesses will start receiving access to Comcast service starting in June with construction expected to continue through February 2024. Once construction is complete, all of these homes and businesses will have the foundational next-generation network in place to introduce new multi-gigabit Internet options.Comcast is introducing fiber-rich network improvements that will offer Oregon customers upload speeds up to 10 times faster than the fastest they have now. And the network upgrade will extend throughout Comcast’s service area in Oregon to every community, zip code, and neighborhood served by the network.“We know that high-speed Internet access in rural areas is linked to increased job and population growth, higher rates of new business formation and home values, and lower unemployment rates,” said Rodrigo Lopez, Senior Regional Vice President of Comcast’s Pacific Northwest Region. ““That is why Comcast is committed to expanding its existing network to additional underserved residents, businesses and communities in Oregon that currently do not have access to reliable, high-speed Internet.”The network expansion is the latest example of Comcast’s investment to connect more households and businesses in the Pacific Northwest to its Internet services that deliver fast speeds, more reliability, broader coverage in the home, and greater capacity to support customers’ growing Internet usage. Comcast expanded service to more than 19,000 additional homes and businesses last year in Oregon. Further, the company has invested more than $504 million in technology and infrastructure investments in Oregon during the previous three years, including network expansion and upgrades.Eagle Creek and Estacada residents also will have access to Internet Essentials, the largest and most comprehensive low-cost Internet adoption program for low-income Americans. Comcast proudly participates in the Affordable Connectivity Program, and offers Internet Essentials Plus, a $29.95/month home Internet service that is effectively free for eligible households, once the ACP credit is applied.
