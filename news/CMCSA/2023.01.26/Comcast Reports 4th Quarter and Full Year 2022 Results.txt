Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA) today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022.

"I am proud of how our team executed throughout 2022," said Brian L. Roberts, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Comcast Corporation. "We achieved the highest levels of Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS in our history and returned a record $17.7 billion of capital to shareholders. We delivered impressive revenue growth in broadband; grew wireless lines by 1.3 million, our best result since launch; more than doubled our Peacock subscribers, surpassing 20 million at year-end; nearly tripled Peacock revenue to $2.1 billion; ranked second in worldwide box office; and generated record Adjusted EBITDA at our theme parks. Importantly, we achieved these results while continuing to invest in broadband, our 10G network evolution, Xfinity Mobile, Peacock, and theme parks, and we also took cost actions to further our growth in the future. We are excited to begin the new year as an innovative leader in large profitable markets with a strong balance sheet and a strategy to drive incremental returns and bring outstanding content and experiences to our customers. The Board's confidence in our position and path forward is underscored by today's announcement that we are increasing our dividend for the 15th consecutive year."

Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.9% to $6.0 billion.

Media
Media revenue increased 2.6% to $6.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, due to higher advertising revenue and distribution revenue. Excluding $263 million generated by Telemundo's broadcast of the FIFA World Cup5, Media revenue decreased 1.9%. Advertising revenue increased 4.0%, primarily due to incremental revenue from the FIFA World Cup as well as an increase in Peacock advertising revenue. Distribution revenue increased 3.8%, reflecting an increase in subscribers at Peacock and contractual rate increases, partially offset by a decline in subscribers at our networks. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 81.7% to $132 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting higher operating expenses, which more than offset higher revenue. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher programming and production costs, reflecting higher costs at Peacock and higher sports programming costs associated with Telemundo's broadcast of the FIFA World Cup. Media results include $660 million of revenue and an Adjusted EBITDA6 loss of $978 million related to Peacock, compared to $335 million of revenue and an Adjusted EBITDA6 loss of $559 million in the prior year period.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, revenue from the Media segment increased 2.7% to $23.4 billion, primarily due to higher distribution revenue and advertising revenue. Excluding $1.7 billion of incremental revenue from the Beijing Olympics, the NFL's Super Bowl and the FIFA World Cup in 20225 and $1.8 billion of incremental revenue from the Tokyo Olympics in 20215, Media revenue increased 3.0%. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 29.7% to $3.2 billion, reflecting higher operating expenses, which more than offset higher revenue. The increase in operating expenses was due to higher programming and production expenses, other operating and administrative expenses and advertising, marketing and promotion expenses. Media results include $2.1 billion of revenue and an Adjusted EBITDA6 loss of $2.5 billion related to Peacock, compared to $778 million of revenue and an Adjusted EBITDA6 loss of $1.7 billion in 2021.

Studios
Studios revenue increased 13.1% to $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, due to higher content licensing and theatrical revenue. Content licensing revenue increased 15.9%, primarily due to the timing of when content was made available by our film and television studios under licensing agreements, including additional sales of content as production levels returned to normal. Theatrical revenue increased 47.3%, primarily due to the successful performance of recent releases, including Ticket to Paradise, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, Violent Night and Halloween Ends. Adjusted EBITDA increased $109 million to $160 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting higher revenue, which more than offset higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was driven by an increase in advertising, marketing and promotion expenses reflecting the size and timing of this quarter's theatrical slate, as well as higher programming and production expenses, reflecting higher amortization of film production costs in the current year period.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, revenue from the Studios segment increased 23.0% to $11.6 billion, primarily reflecting higher content licensing revenue and theatrical revenue. Adjusted EBITDA increased 6.6% to $942 million, reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses.

Theme Parks Adjusted EBITDA increased 16.0% to $782 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, revenue from the Theme Parks segment increased 49.3% to $7.5 billion, primarily reflecting improved operating conditions compared to 2021, when each of our theme parks in the U.S. and Japan was either operating at limited capacity or closed during certain periods as a result of COVID-19, as well as the operations of Universal Beijing Resort, which opened in September 2021. Adjusted EBITDA increased $1.4 billion to $2.7 billion, reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses.

Headquarters and Other
NBCUniversal Headquarters and Other includes overhead, personnel costs and costs associated with corporate initiatives. Headquarters and Other Adjusted EBITDA loss in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $353 million, compared to a loss of $197 million in the prior year period. The year-over-year change was driven by $182 million in severance expense in the current year period.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, Headquarters and Other Adjusted EBITDA loss was $881 million, compared to a loss of $840 million in 2021.

Eliminations

Revenue for Sky decreased 13.0% to $4.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue was consistent with the prior year period. Direct-to-consumer revenue of $3.5 billion was consistent with the prior year period, reflecting increased revenue in the U.K., driven by higher mobile and broadband revenue, offset by decreased revenue in Germany and Italy. Advertising revenue decreased 9.6% to $564 million, primarily reflecting lower revenue in the U.K., including the impact of the timing of the FIFA World Cup. Content revenue increased 6.5% to $304 million, primarily due to the timing of licensing our content to other platforms.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, Sky revenue decreased 11.5% to $17.9 billion. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue decreased 1.2%, reflecting lower direct-to-consumer revenue, content revenue and advertising revenue.

Total Customer Relationships increased by 129,000 to 23.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, total customer relationships increased by 88,000.

Adjusted EBITDA for Sky decreased 26.7% to $340 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding the impact of currency, Adjusted EBITDA decreased 15.1% compared to the prior year period, reflecting consistent revenue and higher operating expenses, including $53 million in higher severance expense. Excluding the higher severance5, Adjusted EBITDA decreased 2.0%. The increase in operating expenses was due to higher other costs, including the higher severance, as well as higher direct network costs driven by growth in our residential mobile and broadband businesses, largely offset by lower sports programming costs due to the timing of sporting events, including a shift of certain football matches out of the fourth quarter of 2022 due to the FIFA World Cup.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, Adjusted EBITDA for Sky increased 7.0% to $2.5 billion. Excluding the impact of currency, Adjusted EBITDA increased 20.3%.

Corporate, Other and Eliminations

 

Corporate and Other
Corporate and Other primarily relates to corporate operations, Comcast Spectacor, Sky Glass and Xumo, our streaming platform joint venture with Charter Communications. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $313 million, compared to $215 million in the prior year period. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA loss was $417 million, compared to a loss of $481 million in the prior year period.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, Corporate and Other revenue was $863 million, compared to $461 million in 2021. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.4 billion was consistent with 2021.

Eliminations
Amounts represent eliminations of transactions between Cable Communications, NBCUniversal, Sky and other businesses. Eliminations of transactions between NBCUniversal segments are presented separately. Revenue eliminations in the fourth quarter of 2022 of $707 million were consistent with the prior year period, and Adjusted EBITDA eliminations were $28 million compared to $21 million in the prior year period.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, revenue eliminations were $2.9 billion compared to $3.0 billion in 2021, and Adjusted EBITDA eliminations were a loss of $64 million compared to a loss of $65 million in 2021. Amounts reflect eliminations associated with the Beijing and Tokyo Olympics in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Notes:

1

We define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation and diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders, respectively, adjusted to exclude the effects of the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, investments that investors may want to evaluate separately (such as based on fair value) and the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges that affect period-over-period comparisons. See Table 5 for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures.

2

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. See Table 4 for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measure.

3

All earnings per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis.

4

We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities (as stated in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) reduced by capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets. From time to time, we may exclude from Free Cash Flow the impact of certain cash receipts or payments (such as significant legal settlements) that affect period-to-period comparability. Cash payments related to certain capital or intangible assets, such as the construction of Universal Beijing Resort, are presented separately in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and are therefore excluded from capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets for Free Cash Flow. See Table 4 for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measure.

5

From time to time, we may present adjusted information (e.g., Adjusted Revenues) to exclude the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges affecting period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. See Table 7 and Table 8 for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures.

6

Adjusted EBITDA is the measure of profit or loss for our segments. From time to time, we may present Adjusted EBITDA for components of our reportable segments, such as Peacock. We believe these measures are useful to evaluate our financial results and provide a basis of comparison to others, although our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA for components are generally presented on a consistent basis with the respective segments and include direct revenue and operating costs and expenses attributed to the component operations.

7

Sky constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the current period results to the comparative period results in the prior year adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective prior year periods. See Table 6 for reconciliation of Sky's constant currency growth.
