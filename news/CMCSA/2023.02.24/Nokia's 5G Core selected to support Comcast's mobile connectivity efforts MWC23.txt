Finland - Nokia and Comcast today announced plans to use Nokia's 5G software and support services to provide Comcast with the capabilities to deliver new, seamless connectivity experiences to Xfinity Mobile and Comcast Business Mobile customers in its service areas across the United States.Nokia will supply Comcast with its 5G Stand Alone Core networking software, including Packet Core, delivering near zero touch automation and ultra low latency capabilities, as well as operations software and consulting services. These offerings will support Comcast's efforts to deliver enhanced 5G access to consumer and business customers in the U.S. using Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) and 600 MHz spectrum.By combining Nokia's software with Comcast's targeted, capital-light network design, Comcast can cost-effectively deliver enhanced 5G and WiFi mobile connectivity to its more than five million Xfinity Mobile and Comcast Business Mobile customers. Comcast and Nokia are currently conducting field trials, which includes Comcast employee testing.As the demand for reliable Internet access inside and outside of the home and office rapidly increases, Comcast's mid-band (CBRS) and low-band (600MHz) spectrum enable the company to supplement its existing Xfinity WiFi network and cellular network partnership with additional targeted 5G coverage in certain high-traffic areas within its service territory.Xfinity Mobile and Comcast Business Mobile services are built for the way people use mobile today, with the Internet at the core of the experience. Calls and texts are free, and customers can experience the freedom of paying by the gig or unlimited, and switch between payment options at any time for any line on their account.Nokia is leading the 5G Standalone Core market, with over 80 communication service provider (CSP) customers around the world. In addition, 25 of the top 40 CSPs by revenue rely on Nokia Core network products.Tom Nagel, SVP, Wireless Strategy at Comcast, said: 'We are pleased to be working with Nokia to enable Comcast's advanced 5G mobile products and services for our customers.
