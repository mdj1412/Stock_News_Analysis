Sky said its re-organisation could affect up to 1,200 staff, workers and contractors, of whom 400 were part of a previous announcement on a restructuring.Alongside voluntary redundancy packages, Sky said it would move some of its activities in house and offer restraining programmes, which would contain the final size of the cuts.    Sky, owned by U.S. company Comcast, employs some 10,000 people in Italy, including contractors.In recent years, the pay-TV broadcaster's operating model has been challenged by streaming services which offer flat-rate deals to view movies, series and premium sport content via internet-enabled devices.
