        (As Revised March 13, 2023)
      

        As described in the Current Report on Form 8-K issued on March 13, 2023, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, Comcast Corporation will change its presentation of segment operating results around its two primary businesses, Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Experiences. A summary of the reportable business segments under the new reporting structure follows:
      

Connectivity & Platforms: Contains our broadband and wireless connectivity businesses operated under the Xfinity and Comcast brands in the United States and under the Sky brand in Europe (the "Connectivity & Platforms markets"). Also includes our video services businesses and the operations of our Sky-branded entertainment television channels in the Connectivity & Platforms markets. Connectivity & Platforms will be reported in two reportable business segments:
      


Residential Connectivity & Platforms: includes residential broadband and wireless connectivity services, residential and business video services, advertising sales and the Sky channels.
        

Business Services Connectivity: includes connectivity services for small business locations, which include broadband, voice and wireless services, as well as our solutions
        


        for medium-sized customers and larger enterprises.
      

Content & Experiences: Contains our media and entertainment businesses that develop, produce and distribute entertainment, news and information, sports, and other content for global audiences and own and operate theme parks in the United States and Asia. Content & Experiences will be reported in three reportable business segments:
      


Media: includes primarily NBCUniversal's television and streaming platforms, including national and regional cable networks; the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks; NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations; and Peacock, our direct-to-consumer streaming service. Also includes international networks, including most Sky Sports channels, and other digital properties.
        

Studios: includes primarily our NBCUniversal and Sky film and television studio production and distribution operations.
        

Theme Parks: includes primarily the operations of our Universal theme parks.
        


        The segment information in these trending schedules has been recast to the new segment structure for all periods presented.
