Jan 30 (Reuters) - Dollar General Corp's Chief
Financial Officer John Garratt would retire effective June 2,
the discount store chain said on Monday, adding that it will
"evaluate options" for its next finance chief.The company is not currently conducting an external search
for Garratt's replacement, it said in a statement, citing its
"robust succession plans"Garratt's retirement comes at a time when retailers are
facing a shift in consumer spending patterns, as penny-pinched
Americans cut back on discretionary items and trade down to
cheaper alternatives such as dollar stores for grocery needs.While that has helped boost sales at Dollar General, the
company in December trimmed its annual profit forecast, as cost
pressures tied to its supply chain problems continued to squeeze
its margins.Garratt, who joined the company in 2014 and was named the
CFO a year later, said "while I look forward to spending more
time with family, this was a difficult personal decision.""The timing of the announcement with John assuming the
President title just six months ago does strike us as a bit
unusual, but we don't think there is anything more to read into
the news," said Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom.The Tennessee-based retailer in July last year named Jeff
Owen its chief executive, replacing Todd Vasos, who stepped down
in November to take on an advisory role until April. Vasos is
set to retire from the company after that.Last week, rival Dollar Tree Inc said Executive
Chairman Richard Dreiling, would replace Chief Executive Officer
Mike Witynski, nearly a year after its settlement with an
activist investor. Dreiling has previously served as chairman
and CEO of Dollar General.
