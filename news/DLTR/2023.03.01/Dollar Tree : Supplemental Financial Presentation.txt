          This Supplemental Financial Presentation contains "forward-looking statements," as that term is used in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, concerning our sales, comparable store sales, selling square footage, depreciation, net interest expense, effective tax rate, diluted earnings per share, and capital expenditures for the first quarter and fiscal year 2023; our diluted earnings per share and new store growth for the first and second halves of fiscal year 2023; and our shipping rate categories and ports of entry for imported goods for fiscal 2023.
        

          These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in these statements.
        

          For information on the risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please see the "Risk Factors," "Business" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" sections in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed March 15, 2022, our Form 10-Q for the most recently ended fiscal quarter, and other filings we make from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
        

          The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on the company's plans, estimates and expectations as of March 1, 2023, and you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing the company's views after such date.
