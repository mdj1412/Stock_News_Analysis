Gamgort continued, "In 2022 we made multiple strategic investments in new platforms and categories through innovation, partnerships and equity investments that support our vision of a "Modern Beverage Company" and provide fuel for future growth.  Further, we continued to enhance our positive impact on all stakeholders through continued achievement of our ambitious 'Drink Well. Do Good.' corporate responsibility commitments."

1 Adjusted financial metrics presented in this release are non-GAAP and with growth rates presented on a constant currency basis. See reconciliations of GAAP results to Adjusted results on a constant currency basis in the accompanying tables.
2022 Full Year Consolidated ResultsNet sales for the full year of 2022 increased 10.8% to $14.06 billion, compared to $12.68 billion in the year-ago period and, on a constant currency basis, net sales advanced 11.1%.  Driving the constant currency net sales growth was favorable net price realization of 10.6% and higher volume/mix of 0.5%, which reflected the strength of the Company's brand portfolio, continued strong in-market execution and modest elasticities.  
KDP in-market performance in the Liquid Refreshment Beverages (LRB) category remained strong for the year, with retail dollar consumption2 advancing 11.0% and KDP growing market share of the category, largely reflecting strength in premium unflavored waters, seltzers, coconut waters, apple juice, tea and fruit drinks, and solid performance in CSDs3.  This performance was driven by CORE Hydration, Polar seltzers, Vita Coco, Mott's, Snapple, Hawaiian Punch and Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, A&W, Sunkist and Squirt CSDs.   
In coffee, retail dollar consumption of single-serve pods manufactured by KDP increased 4.9% in IRi tracked channels, led by higher pricing.  KDP Manufactured share remained strong at 82.4% for the year.
GAAP operating income for the year decreased 10.0% to $2.61 billion, compared to $2.89 billion in the year-ago period, primarily reflecting an unfavorable year-over-year impact of items affecting comparability totaling $406 million.  Also impacting the performance were the benefits of higher gross profit, a change in accounting for non-cash stock compensation expense, recovery of litigation expenses associated with our successful Body Armor settlement, a business interruption insurance recovery and a modest year-over-year gain from the Company's strategic asset investment program.  These benefits were partially offset by significantly higher inflationary pressures in transportation, warehousing and labor.  Excluding items affecting comparability, Adjusted operating income increased 3.7% to $3.54 billion and, on a percent of net sales basis, Adjusted operating income was 25.2%.  
GAAP net income for the year decreased 33.1% to $1.44 billion, or $1.01 per diluted share, compared to $2.15 billion, or $1.50 per diluted share, in the year-ago period.  This performance primarily reflected the decrease in GAAP operating income and an unfavorable year-over-year impact of non-operating items affecting comparability.  This performance was partially offset by the growth in Adjusted operating income and lower Adjusted interest expense.  Excluding items affecting comparability, Adjusted net income for the year advanced 5.4% to $2.40 billion, and Adjusted diluted EPS increased 5.0% to $1.68, compared to $1.60 in the year-ago period.
Free cash flow for the year was strong at $2.65 billion, reflecting a slight decrease in operating cash flow more than offset by lower capital spending.
During the year, the Company repurchased approximately 10.6 million KDP shares at an average price per share of $35.88, totaling approximately $379 million. The Company has approximately $3.6 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization expiring on December 31, 2025.

2022 Full Year Segment Results
Coffee SystemsNet sales for the year increased 5.6% to $4.98 billion, compared to $4.72 billion in the year-ago period and, on a constant currency basis, net sales advanced 6.2%.  The constant currency net sales growth was driven by a 7.0% increase in net price realization, partially offset by a 0.8% decrease in volume/mix driven by brewers.
The higher net price realization of 7.0% for the year primarily reflected pricing actions taken in late 2021 and the second quarter of 2022, while the volume/mix decrease of 0.8% was due to pod shipment growth of 1.4%, more than offset by an expected brewer shipment decline of 5.2%, due to lapping a COVID-related brewer sales acceleration in the prior year.  The Company added approximately two million net new U.S. households to the Keurig system in 2022, in line with its long-term annual target, reflecting successful innovation including new connected brewer models.
GAAP operating income for the year decreased 9.0% to $1.32 billion, compared to $1.45 billion in the year-ago period.  The performance largely reflected broad-based inflationary pressure that was only partially offset by the growth in net sales, productivity, a $44 million benefit from the Company's strategic asset investment program and a $23 million benefit related to the aforementioned insurance recovery.  Adjusted operating income decreased 7.5% to $1.51 billion and, on a percent of net sales basis, totaled 30.4%.
Packaged BeveragesNet sales for the year increased 12.3% to $6.61 billion, compared to $5.88 billion in the year-ago period and, on a constant currency basis, net sales advanced 12.4%.  This continued strong performance was driven by higher net price realization of 12.1% and increased volume/mix of 0.3%, the latter reflecting continued strength of the portfolio and strong in-market execution.  Broad-based strength was led by CSDs, Mott's, Snapple, CORE Hydration, Hawaiian Punch, Polar seltzers and Evian.  KDP's highly successful Zero Sugar launch across much of the CSD portfolio, the Snapple refresh, as well as the Snapple Elements and Mott's Mighty launches, proved incremental. 
GAAP operating income for the year decreased 0.9% to $1.01 billion, compared to $1.02 billion in the year-ago period, reflecting a modest unfavorable impact of items affecting comparability and a significant increase in transportation, warehousing and labor costs, as well as a year-over-year headwind of $32 million from the Company's strategic asset investment program.  More than offsetting these factors were the benefits of the strong net sales growth and productivity.  Excluding items affecting comparability, Adjusted operating income increased 1.2% to $1.13 billion and, on a percent of net sales basis, totaled 17.1%.
Beverage ConcentratesNet sales for the year increased 16.1% to $1.73 billion, compared to $1.49 billion in the year-ago period and, on a constant currency basis, net sales advanced 16.4%.  This strong performance was driven by higher net price realization of 14.7% and favorable volume/mix of 1.7%, as elasticities remained modest.   
Total shipment volume for the year increased 1.6% versus the year-ago period, reflecting increases in Dr Pepper and Canada Dry, partly offset by declines in Schweppes and Crush.  Bottler case sales volume for the year was essentially even with the year-ago period.
GAAP operating income for the year increased 1.3% to $1.06 billion, compared to $1.05 billion in the year-ago period, primarily reflecting the strong net sales performance, which more than offset inflation and an unfavorable impact of items affecting comparability.  Excluding items affecting comparability, Adjusted operating income increased 16.9% to $1.23 billion and, on a percent of net sales basis, totaled 71.5%.
Latin America BeveragesNet sales for the year increased 24.0% to $743 million, compared to net sales of $599 million in the year-ago period and, on a constant currency basis, net sales advanced 23.0%.  This strong and balanced performance was driven by higher net price realization of 13.9% and increased volume/mix of 9.1%, reflecting the strength of the portfolio and continued strong in-market execution.  Leading the net sales growth were Peñafiel, Clamato, Mott's and Squirt.  
GAAP operating income for the year increased 18.8% to $158 million, compared to $133 million in the year-ago period, reflecting the strong net sales growth, productivity and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by broad-based inflationary pressure, significantly higher marketing investment and a slightly unfavorable year-over-year impact of items affecting comparability.  Excluding items affecting comparability and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, Adjusted operating income increased 18.5% to $162 million and, on a percent of net sales basis, totaled 21.8%.
Fourth Quarter Consolidated ResultsNet sales for the fourth quarter increased 12.1% to $3.80 billion, compared to $3.39 billion in the year-ago period.  On a constant currency basis, net sales advanced 12.4% with all four segments growing at a double-digit rate.  Driving the consolidated net sales growth was favorable net price realization of 13.1%, only slightly offset by lower volume/mix of 0.7%, reflecting continued modest elasticities and exceptional in-market execution.  
KDP in-market performance in the LRB category remained strong in the quarter, with retail dollar consumption4 advancing 12.2% and total LRB dollar share posting another quarter of growth, largely reflecting strength in premium unflavored waters, seltzers, apple juice and fruit drinks, combined with continued solid performance in CSDs.  This performance was driven by CORE Hydration, Evian, Polar seltzers, Mott's, Hawaiian Punch and Dr Pepper, Crush, Canada Dry, A&W, Schweppes and Squirt CSDs.
In coffee, retail dollar consumption of single-serve pods manufactured by KDP increased 7.1% in IRi tracked channels, led by higher pricing.  KDP Manufactured share remained strong at approximately 83% in the quarter, driven by strength of owned and licensed pods.
GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter decreased 7.2% to $673 million, compared to $725 million in the year-ago period, primarily reflecting an unfavorable year-over-year impact of items affecting comparability, as well as continued broad-based inflationary pressure and a net $26 million year-over year headwind from the Company's strategic asset investment program.  Partially offsetting these factors were the higher net sales growth, increased gross profit and the benefit of the aforementioned business interruption insurance recovery that totaled $23 million.  Excluding items affecting comparability, Adjusted operating income increased 13.2% to $1.03 billion and, on a percent of net sales basis, Adjusted operating income was 27.0%.
GAAP net income in the fourth quarter decreased 46.3% to $453 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to $843 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, in the year-ago period, primarily reflecting the unfavorable year-over-year impact of items affecting comparability, partially offset by the double-digit growth in Adjusted operating income.  Excluding items affecting comparability, Adjusted net income in the quarter advanced 11.6% to $714 million, while Adjusted diluted EPS increased 11.1% to $0.50, compared to $0.45 in the year-ago period.

Fourth Quarter Segment Results
Coffee SystemsNet sales for the fourth quarter increased 12.7% to $1.49 billion, compared to $1.32 billion in the year-ago period and, on a constant currency basis, net sales advanced 13.8%.  The constant currency net sales growth was driven by a 10.6% increase in net price realization and a 3.2% increase in volume/mix, including a modest benefit of the 53rd week in 2022.
The higher net price realization of 10.6% in the quarter was primarily driven by pricing actions taken in late 2021 and the second quarter of 2022, while the volume/mix increase of 3.2% was due to pod shipment growth of 2.9% and brewer shipment growth of 3.3%.
GAAP operating income increased 22.3% to $438 million, compared to $358 million in the year-ago period, largely reflecting the strong net sales growth and productivity, as well as the $44 million benefit from the Company's strategic asset investment program and the $23 million benefit related to the aforementioned insurance recovery.  Also modestly benefiting the performance was the impact of the 53rd week.  These benefits more than offset broad-based inflationary pressure in the quarter.  Excluding items affecting comparability, Adjusted operating income increased 18.8% to $483 million and, on a percent of net sales basis, totaled 32.5%.
Packaged BeveragesNet sales for the fourth quarter increased 9.9% to $1.68 billion, compared to $1.53 billion in the year-ago period and, on a constant currency basis, net sales advanced 10.1%.  This performance was driven by higher net price realization of 14.9%, partially offset by a 4.8% decrease in volume/mix, as the segment lapped volume/mix growth of 10.3% in the year-ago period.  Broad-based net sales growth across the portfolio was led by CSDs, Mott's, Snapple, Hawaiian Punch, Evian and Polar seltzers.
GAAP operating income decreased 2.1% to $286 million, compared to $292 million in the year-ago period, primarily reflecting the strong net sales growth and productivity, more than offset by a $70 million year-over-year headwind from the Company's strategic asset investment program and continued broad-based inflation.  Excluding items affecting comparability, Adjusted operating income decreased 1.3% to $311 million and, on a percent of net sales basis, totaled 18.5%.
Beverage ConcentratesNet sales for the fourth quarter increased 14.3% to $447 million, compared to $391 million in the year-ago period and, on a constant currency basis, advanced 14.8%.  This strong net sales performance was driven by higher net price realization of 14.3% and favorable volume/mix of 0.5%.
Total shipment volume increased 1.2% versus the year-ago period, reflecting increases in Dr Pepper and Schweppes.  Bottler case sales volume was essentially even with the year-ago period.
GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter decreased 45.3% to $146 million, compared to $267 million in the year-ago period, reflecting the strong net sales growth more than offset by the unfavorable year-over-year impact of items affecting comparability.  Excluding items affecting comparability, Adjusted operating income increased 14.3% to $310 million and, on a percent of net sales basis, totaled 69.4%.
Latin America BeveragesNet sales for the fourth quarter increased 24.3% to $189 million, compared to net sales of $152 million in the year-ago period and, on a constant currency basis, advanced 17.8%.  This strong and balanced performance was driven by higher net price realization of 13.2% and increased volume/mix of 4.6%, reflecting the continued strength of the portfolio and continued strong in-market execution.  Leading the net sales growth were Peñafiel and Clamato.  
GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter increased 15.8% to $44 million, compared to $38 million in the year-ago period, reflecting the strong net sales growth, productivity and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by broad-based inflationary pressure, significantly higher marketing investment and a slightly unfavorable year-over-year impact of items affecting comparability.  Excluding items affecting comparability and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, Adjusted operating income increased 10.5% to $45 million and, on a percent of net sales basis, totaled 23.8%.
KDP 2023 GuidanceThe 2023 guidance provided below is presented on a constant currency, non-GAAP basis.  The Company does not provide reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP measures to GAAP due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of impacts outside of the Company's control on certain items, such as non-cash gains or losses resulting from mark-to-market adjustments of derivative instruments, among others.
KDP expects net sales growth of 5% and Adjusted diluted EPS growth of 6% to 7% in 2023, primarily reflecting an improved relationship between pricing and inflation.  Foreign currency translation is expected to approximate a half of one percentage point headwind to both net sales and Adjusted EPS growth.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTSCertain statements contained herein are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of applicable securities laws and regulations. These forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of words such as "outlook," "guidance," "anticipate," "expect," "believe," "could," "estimate," "feel," "forecast," "intend," "may," "plan," "potential," "project," "should," "target," "will," "would," and similar words. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. These statements are based on the current expectations of our management, are not predictions of actual performance, and actual results may differ materially.
Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. We are under no obligation to update, modify or withdraw any forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThis release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures including Adjusted operating income, Adjusted net income, Adjusted diluted EPS, free cash flow and financial measures presented on a constant currency basis, which differ from results using U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplements to the GAAP reported measures, should not be considered replacements for, or superior to, the GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures typically exclude certain charges, including one-time costs that are not expected to occur routinely in future periods. The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures internally to focus management on performance excluding these special charges to gauge our business operating performance. Management believes this information is helpful to investors because it increases transparency and assists investors in understanding the underlying performance of the Company and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends. Additionally, management believes that non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by analysts and investors in their evaluation of companies, and their continued inclusion provides consistency in financial reporting and enables analysts and investors to perform meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures are set forth in the appendix to this release and included in the Company's filings with the SEC.
To the extent that the Company provides guidance, it does so only on a non-GAAP basis and does not provide reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP measures to GAAP due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of impacts outside of the Company's control on certain items, such as non-cash gains or losses resulting from mark-to-market adjustments of derivative instruments, among others.

KEURIG DR PEPPER INC.RECONCILIATION OF CERTAIN NON-GAAP INFORMATION(UNAUDITED)
The company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures that reflect the way management evaluates the business may provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results, trends and ongoing performance on a comparable basis.
Specifically, investors should consider the following with respect to our financial results:
Adjusted: Defined as certain financial statement captions and metrics adjusted for certain items affecting comparability.
Items affecting comparability: Defined as certain items that are excluded for comparison to prior year periods, adjusted for the tax impact as applicable. Tax impact is determined based upon an approximate rate for each item. For each period, management adjusts for (i) the unrealized mark-to-market impact of derivative instruments not designated as hedges in accordance with U.S. GAAP that do not have an offsetting risk reflected within the financial results, as well as the unrealized mark-to-market impact of our Vita Coco investment; (ii) the amortization associated with definite-lived intangible assets; (iii) the amortization of the deferred financing costs associated with the DPS Merger; (iv) the amortization of the fair value adjustment of the senior unsecured notes obtained as a result of the DPS Merger; (v) stock compensation expense and the associated windfall tax benefit attributable to the matching awards made to employees who made an initial investment in KDP; (vi) non-cash changes in deferred tax liabilities related to goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of tax rate or apportionment changes; and (vii) other certain items that are excluded for comparison purposes to prior year periods.
For the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2022, the other certain items excluded for comparison purposes include (i) restructuring and integration expenses related to significant business combinations; (ii) productivity expenses; (iii) costs related to significant non-routine legal matters, specifically the antitrust litigation; (iv) the loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the redemption of debt; (v) incremental costs to our operations related to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which were incurred to either maintain the health and safety of our front-line employees or temporarily increase compensation to such employees to ensure essential operations continue during the pandemic; (vi) the gain on the sale of our investment in BodyArmor as a result of the settlement of the associated holdback liability; (vii) the gain on the settlement of our prior litigation with BodyArmor, excluding recoveries of previously incurred litigation expenses which were included in our adjusted results; (viii) losses recognized with respect to our equity method investment in Bedford as a result of funding our share of their wind-down costs; (ix) transaction costs for significant business combinations (completed or abandoned); (x) foundational projects, which are transformative and non-recurring in nature; and (xi) impairments recognized on certain intangible brand assets.
For the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2021, the other certain items excluded for comparison purposes include (i) restructuring and integration expenses related to significant business combinations; (ii) productivity expenses; (iii) costs related to significant non-routine legal matters; (iv) the loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the redemption of debt; (v) incremental costs to our operations related to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; (vi) gains from insurance recoveries related to the February 2019 organized malware attack on our business operation networks in the Coffee Systems segment; (vii) the gain on the sale of our investment in BodyArmor; (viii) impairment recognized on our equity method investment with Bedford as a result of funding our share of their wind-down costs; and (ix) transaction costs for significant business combinations (completed or abandoned).
Constant currency adjusted: Defined as certain financial statement captions and metrics adjusted for certain items affecting comparability, calculated on a constant currency basis by converting our current period local currency financial results using the prior period foreign currency exchange rates.
For the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the supplemental financial data set forth below includes reconciliations of adjusted and constant currency adjusted financial measures to the applicable financial measure presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the same period.
