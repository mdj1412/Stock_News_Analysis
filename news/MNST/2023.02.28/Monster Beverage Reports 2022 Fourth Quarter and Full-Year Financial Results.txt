Operating income for the 2022 fourth quarter was $394.4 million, compared with $412.9 million in the 2021 fourth quarter. Operating income for the 2022 fourth quarter decreased primarily as a result of the decrease in the gross profit as a percentage of net sales, as well as the increase in operating expenses.The effective tax rate for both 2022 and 2021 fourth quarters was 23.3 percent. Net income for the 2022 fourth quarter decreased 6.1 percent to $301.7 million, from $321.3 million in the 2021 fourth quarter.

Schlosberg said: “We are pleased to report another quarter of continued revenue growth. The energy drink category continues to expand globally. The results from our overseas operations were again overshadowed by the strength of the United States dollar in the quarter. Gross profit margin percentages increased on a sequential quarterly basis as a result of our pricing actions, as well as certain of our supply chain challenges moderating. “We are continuing to deplete the remaining higher cost imported can inventories in the United States and in EMEA, which should be fully utilized during 2023.  “We believe that some of the increased costs that we have experienced in 2022 are likely to be transitory, although cost inflation, including increases in energy particularly in EMEA, ingredient and other input costs, as well as co-packing fees, remain challenging. “Certain price increases are being implemented on a phased approach during the first half of 2023, some in addition to price increases or pricing actions already taken in 2022,” Schlosberg added.Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer said: “We continued to expand distribution of our brands in our domestic and international markets in the fourth quarter of 2022, as well as in the current quarter. In the United States, we launched Monster Energy® Zero Sugar at retail in January 2023, as well as Monster Energy® Ultra Strawberry Dreams, Monster® (stylized) Reserve Kiwi Strawberry, Monster Energy® Nitro Cosmic Peach and Java Monster® Caffe Latte earlier this month. “We recently launched our first flavored malt beverage alcohol product, The Beast Unleashed™ in six states. The Beast Unleashed™ contains six percent alcohol by volume and is available in four flavors. We are pleased with early results and plan to expand into additional markets in the 2023 second quarter, with the goal of being national by the end of the year. We have also commenced with the launch of Monster® Tour Water™, a pure unflavored water line, in still and sparkling variants in 19.2 oz cans. We are planning to launch Reign Storm®, which is positioned as a total wellness energy drink, in 12 oz sleek cans at retail in March 2023 in four flavors, to address a compelling opportunity in the energy drink category. “In EMEA, as part of an ongoing pan-EMEA launch in the first quarter of 2023, we commenced distribution of Monster Energy® Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero Sugar. We also launched Fury, one of our affordable energy brands, in Egypt.“We are planning to transition the Monster brand to the Coca-Cola distribution system in the Philippines in the second quarter of 2023. “Our innovation pipeline of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages continues to be robust,” Sacks added.2022 Full-Year ResultsNet sales for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2022 increased 13.9 percent to $6.31 billion, from $5.54 billion in the comparable period last year.  Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2022 of $239.5 million.
