Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) announced today its results of operations for the fourth quarter and full year 2022.

“2022 marked Gilead’s strongest full year growth in our base business since HCV sales peaked in 2015. This return to growth was driven by consistent and high quality commercial and clinical execution across our portfolio,” said Gilead’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel O’Day. “In HIV, Biktarvy gained market share in the U.S. as it has every quarter since launch, while our long-acting HIV agent, lenacapavir, received its first regulatory approvals. The strong full year growth in oncology was driven by continued increase in demand for Trodelvy and our Cell Therapies. We look forward to building on this momentum in 2023 and further increasing our impact for people and communities worldwide.”

Fourth Quarter 2022 Financial Results

Product Sales Performance for the Fourth Quarter 2022

Total fourth quarter 2022 product sales increased 2% to $7.3 billion compared to the same period in 2021. Total product sales excluding Veklury increased 9% to $6.3 billion for the fourth quarter 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to increased sales in HIV and Oncology as well as contributions from HCV products.

HIV product sales increased 5% to $4.8 billion for the fourth quarter 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, reflecting higher demand and favorable pricing dynamics, partially offset by channel inventory dynamics in the United States.

HCV product sales increased 12% to $439 million for the fourth quarter 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily driven by increased patient starts and favorable pricing dynamics in the United States, partially offset by fewer starts in Europe.

Hepatitis B virus (“HBV”) and hepatitis delta virus (“HDV”) product sales decreased 4% to $255 million for the fourth quarter 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. Vemlidy® (TAF 25 mg) sales decreased 2% in the fourth quarter 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, driven primarily by lower demand and pricing dynamics outside of the United States. Hepcludex® (bulevirtide) contributed $13 million in the fourth quarter 2022 as launch activities continued across Europe.

Cell Therapy product sales increased 75% to $419 million for the fourth quarter 2022 compared to the same period in 2021.

Trodelvy® (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy) sales increased 65% to $195 million for the fourth quarter 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, reflecting continued adoption in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (“TNBC”) in the United States and Europe.

Veklury sales decreased 26% to $1.0 billion for the fourth quarter 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily driven by lower rates of COVID-19 related hospitalizations. Veklury sales generally reflect COVID-19 related rates and severity of infections and hospitalizations, as well as the availability, uptake and effectiveness of vaccinations and alternative treatments for COVID-19.

Full Year 2022 Financial Results

Product Sales Performance for the Full Year 2022

Total full year 2022 product sales were $27.0 billion for the full year 2022 and remained flat compared to the same period in 2021, with growth in HIV, Cell Therapy and Trodelvy, offset by lower Veklury sales. Total product sales excluding Veklury increased 8% to $23.1 billion for the full year 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by increased sales in HIV, Cell Therapy and Trodelvy.

HIV product sales increased 5% to $17.2 billion for the full year 2022 compared to 2021, primarily reflecting higher demand and favorable pricing dynamics, partially offset by channel inventory dynamics and unfavorable foreign exchange rates.

HCV product sales decreased 4% to $1.8 billion for the full year 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, as well as fewer patient starts and unfavorable pricing dynamics.

HBV and HDV product sales increased 2% to $988 million for the full year 2022 compared to 2021, driven primarily by higher demand for Vemlidy, mainly in the United States.

Cell Therapy product sales increased 68% to $1.5 billion for the full year 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher demand for Yescarta in R/R LBCL, as well as Tecartus in R/R ALL and MCL.

Trodelvy sales increased 79% to $680 million for the full year 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting continued adoption in metastatic TNBC in the United States and Europe.

Veklury sales decreased 30% to $3.9 billion for the full year 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by lower rates of COVID-19 related hospitalizations.

Full Year 2022 Product Gross Margin, Operating Expenses and Tax

________________________________

(1)

Beginning in the second quarter of 2022, expenses related to development milestones and other collaboration payments made prior to regulatory approval of a developed product were reclassified from R&D expenses to Acquired IPR&D expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. We believe this presentation assists users of the financial statements to better understand the total costs incurred to acquire IPR&D projects. Prior periods have been recast for both GAAP and Non-GAAP reporting to reflect this classification, resulting in a reduction of previously reported R&D expenses of $669 million and $762 million for the fourth quarter and full year 2021, respectively, and $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022.

Guidance and Outlook

Gilead is providing full-year 2023 guidance below:

A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information for the 2023 guidance is provided in the accompanying tables. Also see the Forward-Looking Statements described below. The financial guidance is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty around the duration and magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Conference Call

At 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time today, Gilead will host a conference call to discuss Gilead’s results. A live webcast will be available on http://investors.gilead.com and will be archived on www.gilead.com for one year.

Non-GAAP Financial Information

The information presented in this document has been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), unless otherwise noted as non-GAAP. Management believes non-GAAP information is useful for investors, when considered in conjunction with Gilead’s GAAP financial information, because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and should only be used to supplement an understanding of Gilead’s operating results as reported under GAAP. Non-GAAP financial information generally excludes acquisition-related expenses including amortization of acquired intangible assets and inventory step-up charges, and other items that are considered unusual or not representative of underlying trends of Gilead’s business, fair value adjustments of equity securities and discrete and related tax charges or benefits associated with changes in tax related laws and guidelines. Although Gilead consistently excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets from the non-GAAP financial information, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of acquisitions and contribute to ongoing revenue generation. Non-GAAP measures may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same industry. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the accompanying tables.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, consistent with recent industry communications from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), Gilead no longer excludes the initial costs of acquired IPR&D projects from its non-GAAP financial measures. Prior period non-GAAP financial measures are revised to conform to the new presentation.

Forward-Looking Statements

Statements included in this press release that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Gilead cautions readers that forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include those relating to: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gilead’s business, financial condition and results of operations; the development, manufacturing and distribution of Veklury as a treatment for COVID-19, including the uncertainty of the amount and timing of future Veklury sales and Gilead’s ability to effectively manage the global supply and distribution of Veklury; Gilead’s ability to achieve its anticipated full year 2023 financial results, including as a result of potential adverse revenue impacts from COVID-19 and potential revenues from Veklury; Gilead’s ability to make progress on any of its long-term ambitions or strategic priorities laid out in its corporate strategy; Gilead’s ability to accelerate or sustain revenues for its virology, oncology and other programs; Gilead’s ability to realize the potential benefits of acquisitions, collaborations or licensing arrangements, including those involving Arcellx, Daiichi Sankyo, EVOQ, Jounce and Tmunity; Gilead’s ability to identify suitable transactions as part of its business strategy and the risk that Gilead may not be able to complete any such transaction in a timely manner or at all, including the possibility that a governmental entity or regulatory body may delay or refuse to grant approval for the consummation of the transaction; patent protection and estimated loss of exclusivity for our products and product candidates; Gilead’s ability to initiate, progress or complete clinical trials within currently anticipated timeframes or at all, the possibility of unfavorable results from ongoing and additional clinical trials, including those involving Trodelvy, Tecartus, Yescarta, domvanalimab, etrumadenant and zimberelimab, and the risk that safety and efficacy data from clinical trials may not warrant further development of Gilead’s product candidates or the product candidates of Gilead’s strategic partners; Gilead’s ability to submit new drug applications for new product candidates or expanded indications in the currently anticipated timelines; Gilead’s ability to receive regulatory approvals in a timely manner or at all, including EC approval of Trodelvy for the treatment of adult patients with pre-treated HR+/HER2 mBC, and the risk that any such approvals, if granted, may be subject to significant limitations on use; Gilead’s ability to successfully commercialize its products; the risk of potential disruptions to the manufacturing and supply chain of Gilead’s products, including the risk that Kite may be unable to increase its manufacturing capacity, timely manufacture and deliver its products or produce an amount of supply sufficient to satisfy demand for such products; pricing and reimbursement pressures from government agencies and other third parties, including required rebates and other discounts; a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments; market share and price erosion caused by the introduction of generic versions of Gilead products; the risk that physicians and patients may not see advantages of these products over other therapies and may therefore be reluctant to prescribe the products, including Biktarvy, Sunlenca, Vemlidy and Yescarta; and other risks identified from time to time in Gilead’s reports filed with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. In addition, Gilead makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. Gilead bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. There may be other factors of which Gilead is not currently aware that may affect matters discussed in the forward-looking statements and may also cause actual results to differ significantly from these estimates. Further, results for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of operating results for any future periods. Gilead directs readers to its press releases, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other subsequent disclosure documents filed with the SEC. Gilead claims the protection of the Safe Harbor contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for forward-looking statements.

The reader is cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and is cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead and Gilead assumes no obligation to update or supplement any such forward-looking statements other than as required by law. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof or as of the dates indicated in the statements.

________________________________

(1)

The non-GAAP 2023 full-year guidance includes non-GAAP adjustments to actual current period results as well as adjustments for the known future impact associated with events that have already occurred, such as future amortization of our intangible assets and the future impact of discrete and related deferred tax charges or benefits primarily associated with acquired intangible assets and transfers of intangible assets from a foreign subsidiary to Ireland and the United States. Our full-year guidance excludes the potential impact of any (i) acquisitions or business development transactions that have not been executed, (ii) future fair value adjustments of equity securities and (iii) discrete tax charges or benefits associated with changes in tax related laws and guidelines that have not been enacted, as Gilead is unable to project such amounts.
