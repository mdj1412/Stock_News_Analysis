These risks and uncertainties, along with the risk factors discussed under "Item 1A.

Please refer to the Q2 fiscal 2023 earnings release available at investors.adp.com for a discussion of why ADP believes these measures are important and for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their closest comparable GAAP financial measures.
