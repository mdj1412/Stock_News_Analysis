Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN), a leading global medical device company that designs, manufactures, and sells the Invisalign® system of clear aligners, iTero™ intraoral scanners, and exocad™ CAD/CAM software for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter ("Q4'22") and year ended December 31, 2022 ("2022"). Q4'22 total revenues were $901.5 million, up 1.3% sequentially and down 12.6% year-over-year. Q4'22 Clear Aligner revenues were $731.7 million, flat sequentially and down 10.3% year-over-year. Q4'22 Clear Aligner volume was up 1.1% sequentially and down 7.5% year-over-year. Q4'22 Imaging Systems and CAD/CAM Services revenues were $169.9 million, up 7.8% sequentially and down 21.3% year-over-year. Q4’22 Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $13.4 million or 1.8% sequentially and approximately $56.4 million or 7.2% year over year.(1) Q4'22 Imaging Systems and CAD/CAM Services revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $2.7 million or 1.5% sequentially and approximately $11.2 million or 6.2% year over year.(1) Q4'22 operating income was $112.7 million resulting in an operating margin of 12.5%. Q4'22 operating margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately 0.9 points sequentially and approximately 4.2 points year over year.(1) Q4'22 net income was $41.8 million, or $0.54 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, Q4'22 net income was $134.2 million, or $1.73 per diluted share. (3)

During Q4’22, we incurred a total of $14.3 million of restructuring and other charges, of which $2.9 million was included in cost of net revenues and $11.5 million included in operating expenses. Restructuring and other charges included $8.7 million of severance related costs and $5.6 million of certain lease terminations costs and asset impairments.

2022 Clear Aligner revenues of $3.1 billion were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $160.8 million or 5.0% compared to 2021.(1) 2022 Imaging Systems and CAD/CAM Services revenues of $662.1 million were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $33.0 million or 4.7% compared to 2021.(1)

In Q4’22, we changed to a long-term projected tax rate in our computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across reporting periods. Our previous methodology for calculating our non-GAAP effective tax rate included certain non-recurring and period-specific items, that produced fluctuating effective tax rates that management does not believe are reflective of the Company's long-term effective tax rate. We have recast all prior periods in 2022 to reflect this change. We did not make any changes to the results reported for 2021 as reflecting the change in methodology for the computation of the non-GAAP effective tax rate was immaterial to our 2021 results. Refer to the section titled "Recast of Financial Measures for Prior Periods in 2022 for Tax Rate Change" under Unaudited GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation for further information.

Commenting on Align's Q4'22 and 2022 results, Align Technology President and CEO Joe Hogan said, “Overall, I’m pleased to report fourth quarter results that reflect a more stable environment for doctors and their patients than recent quarters, especially in the Americas and EMEA regions, as well as most APAC markets outside of China. Throughout Q4, trends in consumer interest for orthodontic treatment, patient traffic in doctor’s practices, and iTero™ scanner demos continued to improve. However, the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange on our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results was unprecedented and reduced our revenues and margins significantly. Despite the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, Q4 revenues of $901.5 million increased sequentially from Q3, reflecting growth in systems and services as well as a slight increase in clear aligner shipments. This is the first quarter in a year that our total revenues and volumes for both scanners and clear aligners increased sequentially. As we move through 2023, I am cautiously optimistic that we will see continued stability and an improving operating environment, but also recognize that the macroeconomic situation is fragile. Regardless, we remain confident in our large, untapped market opportunity for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry. We anticipate that 2023 will be a very exciting year for Align innovations as we begin to commercialize one of the largest new product and technology cycles in our 25-year history.”

We did not make any changes to the results reported for 2021 as reflecting the change in methodology for the computation of the non-GAAP effective tax rate was immaterial to our 2021 results.

(3) In Q4'22, we changed our methodology for the computation of the non-GAAP effective tax rate to a long-term projected tax rate and have given effect to the new methodology from January 1, 2022, and recast the previously reported quarterly periods in 2022. We did not make any changes to the results reported for 2021 as reflecting the change in methodology for the computation of the non-GAAP effective tax rate was immaterial to our 2021 results. Please see section captioned "Recast of Financial Measures for Prior Periods In 2022 For Tax Rate Change" under "Unaudited GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation" for further information.

As of December 31, 2022, we had over $1.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities compared to over $1.1 billion as of September 30, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had $300.0 million available under a revolving line of credit which was amended during Q4'22 to extend the term through 2027. In October 2022, we purchased approximately 848 thousand shares of our common stock at an average price of $188.62 per share through a $200.0 million Accelerated Share Repurchase under our May 13, 2021 $1.0 billion Stock Repurchase Program. We have $250.0 million remaining available for repurchase under this program and we plan to repurchase this remaining amount starting in Q1 2023 through either, or a combination of, open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement, and entirely completing this $1.0 Billion Stock Repurchase Program in Q2 2023.

Commenting on Align's 2022 results, Align Technology CFO and EVP Global Finance, John Morici said, “We remain focused on expanding our technology and industry leadership, while making disciplined investments in our strategic growth drivers. We exited fiscal year 2022 with a strong balance sheet, including $1 billion in cash and investments, a healthy cash flow position and no long-term debt. We are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program to succeed the current $1 billion program. This new $1 billion program reflects the strength of our balance sheet and cash flow generation, as well as management’s and our Board's continued confidence in our ability to capitalize on large market opportunities in our target markets and trajectory for growth while concurrently returning capital to our stockholders.”

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"), we may provide investors with certain non-GAAP financial measures which may include constant currency net revenues, constant currency gross profit, constant currency gross margin, constant currency income from operations, constant currency operating margin, gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses, income from operations, operating margin, interest income and other income (expense), net, net income before provision for income taxes, provision for income taxes, effective tax rate, net income and/or diluted net income per share, which excludes certain items that may not be indicative of our fundamental operating performance including, foreign currency exchange rate impacts and discrete cash and non-cash charges or gains that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measure. In Q4'22, we changed to a long-term non-GAAP effective tax rate in our computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across reporting periods. Our previous methodology for calculating our non-GAAP effective tax rate included certain non-recurring and period-specific items, that produced fluctuating effective tax rates that management does not believe are reflective of the Company's long-term effective tax rate. We have given effect to this new methodology effective January 1, 2022 and recast prior periods in 2022. No changes have been made to 2021, as reflecting the change in methodology for the computation of the non-GAAP effective tax rate was immaterial to our 2021 results. Unless otherwise indicated, when we refer to non-GAAP financial measures they will exclude the effects of stock-based compensation, amortization of certain acquired intangibles, restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related costs, and arbitration award gain, and associated tax impacts.

Our management believes that the use of certain non-GAAP financial measures provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our recurring core operating performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance of our business.

There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures as they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our public disclosures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is meant to be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We urge investors to review the reconciliation of our GAAP financial measures to the comparable non-GAAP financial measures included herein and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Unaudited GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation."

Note:

(1)

We define constant currency net revenues as total net revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and use it to determine the percentage for the constant currency impact on net revenues on a sequential, year-over-year and current year versus prior year basis. Constant currency impact in dollars is calculated by translating the current period GAAP net revenues using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period and subtracting it by the current period GAAP net revenues. The percentage for the constant currency impact on net revenues is calculated by dividing the constant currency impact in dollars (numerator) by constant currency net revenues in dollars (denominator).

Notes:

(1)

Amortization of intangible assets related to certain acquisitions

(2)

During the fourth quarter of 2022, we initiated a restructuring plan to increase efficiencies across the organization and lower the overall cost structure. Restructuring charges recorded to Cost of net revenues relate primarily to severance costs and impairment charges.

(3)

Restructuring and other charges recorded to Operating expenses primarily relate to severance costs, lease termination charges and asset impairments.

(4)

Acquisition-related costs for professional fees related to our 2020 exocad acquisition

(5)

Gain from the SDC arbitration award regarding the value of Align's capital account balance

(6)

In Q4'22, we changed our methodology for the computation of the non-GAAP effective tax rate to a long-term projected tax rate and have given effect to the new methodology from January 1, 2022, and recast previously reported quarterly periods in 2022. We did not make any changes to the results reported for 2021 as reflecting the change in methodology for the computation of the non-GAAP effective tax rate was immaterial to our 2021 results. Please see section captioned "Recast of Financial Measures for Prior Periods In 2022 For Tax Rate Change" under "Unaudited GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation" for further information.

RECAST OF FINANCIAL MEASURES FOR PRIOR PERIODS IN 2022 FOR TAX RATE CHANGE
(in thousands, except per share data)

In Q4'22, we changed our methodology for the computation of the non-GAAP effective tax rate to a long-term projected tax rate as our management believes shifting to a long-term projected tax rate provides better consistency across reporting periods. Our previous methodology for calculating non-GAAP effective tax rate included certain non-recurring and period-specific items that produced, between periods, results management does not believe are reflective of the Company's long-term effective tax rate. We have given effect to the new methodology effective January 1, 2022, and recast the previously reported quarterly periods in 2022 relating to the Non-GAAP provision for income taxes, Non-GAAP effective tax rate, Non-GAAP net income and Non-GAAP diluted net income per share. We used a projected non-GAAP effective tax rate of 20% for 2022, and expect to use the same rate for 2023. The non-GAAP effective tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the evolving global tax environment, significant changes to our geographic earnings mix, or other changes to our strategy or business operations. We will re-evaluate the long-term projected tax rate as appropriate. No changes were made to the results reported for 2021, as reflecting the change in methodology for the computation of the non-GAAP effective tax rate would have been immaterial to our 2021 results.

For the convenience of the reader, we have presented the relevant sections of the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, for all the quarterly periods in 2022, both before and after the non-GAAP effective tax rate methodology change described above.
