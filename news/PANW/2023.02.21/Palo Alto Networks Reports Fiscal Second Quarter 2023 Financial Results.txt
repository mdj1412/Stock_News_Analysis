Fiscal second quarter revenue and billings each grew 26% year over year to $1.7 billion and $2.0 billion, respectivelyTrailing 12-months GAAP net income positive for period ending January 31, 2023Remaining performance obligation grew 39% year over year to $8.8 billionSANTA CLARA, Calif., Feb. 21, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW), the global cybersecurity leader, announced today financial results for its fiscal second quarter 2023, ended January 31, 2023.
Total revenue for the fiscal second quarter 2023 grew 26% year over year to $1.7 billion, compared with total revenue of $1.3 billion for the fiscal second quarter 2022. GAAP net income for the fiscal second quarter 2023 was $84.2 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared with GAAP net loss of $93.5 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the fiscal second quarter 2022.
Non-GAAP net income for the fiscal second quarter 2023 was $331.7 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, compared with non-GAAP net income of $185.0 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, for the fiscal second quarter 2022. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP information is contained in the tables below.
"We continue to see our teams execute well in the midst of macroeconomic challenges, helping customers consolidate their security architectures," said Nikesh Arora, chairman and CEO of Palo Alto Networks. "The performance of our software-based and cloud-delivered portfolio validates the significant investments we have made over the last several years and has enabled us to raise our billings and NGS ARR guidance."
"Our focus on driving profitable growth is reflected in our Q2 results," said Dipak Golechha, chief financial officer of Palo Alto Networks. "As a result, we are raising our cash flow margin and operating profitability targets as we remain focused on driving efficiency in our business."
Financial OutlookPalo Alto Networks provides guidance based on current market conditions and expectations.
For the fiscal third quarter 2023, we expect:
Total billings in the range of $2.20 billion to $2.25 billion, representing year-over-year growth of between 22% and 25%.Total revenue in the range of $1.695 billion to $1.725 billion, representing year-over-year growth of between 22% and 24%.Diluted non-GAAP net income per share in the range of $0.90 to $0.94, using 321 million to 327 million shares outstanding.For the fiscal year 2023, we are updating guidance and expect:
Total billings in the range of $9.10 billion to $9.20 billion, representing year-over-year growth of between 22% and 23%.Total revenue in the range of $6.85 billion to $6.91 billion, representing year-over-year growth of between 25% and 26%.Diluted non-GAAP net income per share in the range of $3.97 to $4.03, using 320 million to 326 million shares outstanding.Adjusted free cash flow margin in the range of 36.5% to 37.5%.Guidance for non-GAAP financial measures excludes share-based compensation-related charges (including share-based payroll tax expense), acquisition-related costs, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, litigation-related charges, including legal settlements, restructuring and other costs, non-cash charges related to convertible notes, foreign currency gains (losses), and income tax and other tax adjustments, along with certain non-recurring expenses and certain non-recurring cash flows. We have not reconciled diluted non-GAAP net income per share guidance to GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share or adjusted free cash flow margin guidance to GAAP net cash from operating activities because we do not provide guidance on GAAP net income (loss) or net cash from operating activities and would not be able to present the various reconciling cash and non-cash items between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures because certain items that impact these measures are uncertain or out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted, including share-based compensation expense, without unreasonable effort. The actual amounts of such reconciling items will have a significant impact on the company's GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share and GAAP net cash from operating activities.

Additional information will also be set forth in other filings that we make with the SEC from time to time.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key MetricsPalo Alto Networks has provided in this press release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures and other key metrics internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics are useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends, and in comparing the company's financial results with other companies in its industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures or key metrics.
The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the company's historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations.
Non-GAAP net income and net income per share, diluted. Palo Alto Networks defines non-GAAP net income as net income (loss) plus share-based compensation-related charges, including share-based payroll tax expense, acquisition-related costs, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, litigation-related charges, including legal settlements, restructuring and other costs, and non-cash charges related to convertible notes. The company also excludes from non-GAAP net income foreign currency gains (losses) and tax adjustments to provide a complete picture of the company's recurring core business operating results. The company defines non-GAAP net income per share, diluted, as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding, which includes the potentially dilutive effect of the company's employee equity incentive plan awards and the company's convertible senior notes outstanding and related warrants, after giving effect to the anti-dilutive impact of the company's note hedge agreements, which reduces the potential economic dilution that otherwise would occur upon conversion of the company's convertible senior notes. Under GAAP, the anti-dilutive impact of the note hedge is not reflected in diluted shares outstanding. The company believes that excluding these items from non-GAAP net income and net income per share, diluted, provides management and investors with greater visibility into the underlying performance of the company's core business operating results, meaning its operating performance excluding these items and, from time to time, other discrete charges that are infrequent in nature, over multiple periods.
Billings. Palo Alto Networks defines billings as total revenue plus the change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue, during the period. The company considers billings to be a key metric used by management to manage the company's business and believes billings provides investors with an important indicator of the health and visibility of the company's business because it includes subscription and support revenue, which is recognized ratably over the contractual service period, and product revenue, which is recognized at the time of hardware shipment or delivery of software license, provided that all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The company considers billings to be a useful metric for management and investors, particularly if sales of subscriptions continue to increase and the company experiences strong renewal rates for subscriptions and support.
Investors are cautioned that there are a number of limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics as analytical tools. In particular, the billings metric reported by the company includes amounts that have not yet been recognized as revenue. Additionally, many of the adjustments to the company's GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in the company's financial results for the foreseeable future, such as share-based compensation, which is an important part of Palo Alto Networks employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Furthermore, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP, and the components that Palo Alto Networks excludes in its calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the components that its peer companies exclude when they report their non-GAAP results of operations. Palo Alto Networks compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures. In the future, the company may also exclude non-recurring expenses and other expenses that do not reflect the company's core business operating results.
