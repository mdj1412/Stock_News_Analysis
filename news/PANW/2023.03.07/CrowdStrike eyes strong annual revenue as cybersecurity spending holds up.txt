March 7 (Reuters) - CrowdStrike Holdings Inc
forecast annual revenue above market estimates on Tuesday, the
latest sign that spending on cybersecurity products was holding
up in a turbulent economy.Shares of the Austin, Texas-based company were up 6% in
trading after the bell."We believe our strong fourth-quarter performance and record
first-quarter pipeline demonstrates the mission-critical nature
of cybersecurity for modern businesses, the resiliency of our
market," said Chief Executive Officer George Kurtz.While tech budgets have shrunk this year in the face of
rising interest rates and decades-high inflation, a series of
high-profile hacks and the rising digital presence of companies
and governments has ensured demand for cybersecurity services.Rival Palo Alto Networks Inc raised its annual
profit forecast last month and beat estimates for quarterly
earnings, saying it expects cybersecurity demand to be
resilient."We continue to see conservatism in revenue guidance for FY
24 amid macro uncertainties, but note the potential upside from
opportunities in its SMB (small-medium businesses) segment from
its exclusive partnership with Dell and emerging product
growth," said Janice Quek, equity analyst at CFRA Research.For the quarter ended Jan. 31, CrowdStrike's revenue rose
48% to $637.4 million compared with a year earlier. Analysts on
average had expected $624.9 million, according to Refinitiv
data.Excluding items, the company earned net income of 47 cents
per share in the fourth quarter, higher than analysts'
expectations of 43 cents.The company said it expects fiscal year 2024 revenue between
$2.96 billion and $3.02 billion, compared with analysts'
estimates of $2.96 billion.On a conference call with analysts, finance chief Burt
Podbere said CrowdStrike expanded its team by 46% in 2022, and
added it would allow the company to significantly moderate its
pace of new hires.(Reporting by Vansh Agarwal in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna
