(Updates story from February 20; updates headline, recasts top,
adds comments from Walmart and General Mills executives)Feb 21 (Reuters) - Prices of everyday basics like Bounty
paper towels and Cadbury chocolate may rise again this year
while those of others like Clorox Co wipes and Diet
Pepsi are likely to remain steady, as manufacturers make
differing bets on the strength of the consumer and their brands.Goods makers' strategies on further price hikes depends on
their leverage with retailers such as Walmart Inc and
Tesco plc, who are pushing back against more increases
in an uncertain economic environment.Once-in-a-generation levels of inflation, stemming from
pandemic supply chain snarls, government stimulus and the
Ukraine war, have pinched shoppers' pocketbooks globally.The decision by companies to boost prices is hitting
demand at big-box retailers like Walmart and Home Depot, both of
which said Tuesday that inflation will result in worse earnings
results for 2023 than previously expected.In Britain, consumers paid 16.7% more for food in the month
to Jan. 22 compared to the same period last year, while U.S.
prices for food eaten at and away from home rose 10.1% in the 12
months ended in January.There are small signs the pressure is easing, with U.S.
consumer prices a month earlier declining for the first time in
two-and-a-half years, due in part to gas prices."While the supply chain issues have largely abated, prices
are still high," said John Rainey, Walmart chief financial
officer, during a call with analysts Tuesday. "There is
considerable pressure on the consumer."As the "tide is turning a little bit," some retailers are
also now asking suppliers for "rollbacks" as the cost of fuel,
for example, falls, another factor driving companies' decisions,
said KPMG consultant Sunder Ramakrishnan."The retailer would drop the shelf price, because
manufacturers agree to sell it for less to the retailer,"
Ramakrishnan said. "It's been a fairly recent phenomenon. Not a
lot of manufacturers are willing to volunteer to cut price."The cost of cardboard cases has decreased by as much as 50%,
and transportation costs have plummeted as well, by 25-30%,
Reuters reported last week. Some plastics and chemicals used in
household goods have risen, executives have said, and labor
remains costly."I'm frustrated by pricing," General Mills Chief Executive
Officer Jeffrey Harmening said Tuesday at the Consumer Analyst
Group of New York's conference in Boca Raton, Florida. "I'm sure
our customers are too. I'm sure consumers are too, but that's
the environment that we're living in."DIFFERENT PREDICTIONSAfter more than a year of consistent price hikes, some
consumer goods makers such as Kraft Mac & Cheese manufacturer
Kraft Heinz Co are pressing pause as they weigh consumer
demand for their items.Kraft's prices went up 13.2 percentage points in 2022 over
the prior year, according to financial disclosures. Kroger Co
is promoting a 20-ounce bottle of Heinz ketchup for $2.49
- below the $3.18 average price per unit of the condiment
according to IRI, a Chicago-based market research firm.Kraft-Heinz CEO Miguel Patricio said last week that private
label, or store brands, are gaining market share, mainly from
the company's competitors.It's riskier for national brands to hike prices on products
where consumers are increasingly buying store brand items, such
as grocery and baby products, according to market research firm
Numerator.But other companies like Nestle SA, the world's
biggest food company, continue to plan price hikes in the future
to recoup margins squeezed by high labor and fuel costs, a
whiplash for consumers aiming to make sense of their household
expenses.Prices on Nestle's products including Coffee Mate creamers
already rose 8.2% last year, with an 11.75 ounce package of its
Stouffer's French bread pizza selling for $3.48 at Walmart.
Frozen pizza prices have risen about 14% in the last year,
according to IRI data."Consumer sensitivity to prices is going up, even in the
last couple months," said Mark Hosbein, an executive at
consulting firm Magid.Magid's data from surveys shows that consumers are spending
dramatically more on groceries, rent and gas, forcing them to
cut back on savings and eat out less. Magid's data also shows
shoppers are opting for cheaper items.BIG BRANDS DIFFERBrands that retailers and consumers see "core" or "very
strong" in their segment also have more pricing power,
Ramakrishnan said, because they help build sales for chains.Coca-Cola Co's CEO James Quincey, for example, said
on Tuesday the company had "earned the right" to push price
hikes on to consumers because its classic Coke and Fanta sodas
lead the beverage category.Executives at Bounty maker Procter & Gamble Co  said
the company was confident the U.S. consumer "is going to hold up
well" over the next few quarters, and planning more increases. A
16-ounce bottle of P&G's Dawn Powerwash dish soap costs $5.99 on
Target.com, after debuting at $4.99 about three years ago
according to media reports."Retailers cannot truly push back on prices â€¦ if the company
has an important brand," Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne said.The average prices consumers are paying for Kraft-Heinz and
PepsiCo Inc products have risen faster than Nestle's,
another reason why both Kraft-Heinz and PepsiCo may be holding
off on hikes for now.PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta has said he expects shoppers to
become more price-sensitive later in the year due to fears of a
recession in the United States, its major market.(Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli in New York and Aishwarya
