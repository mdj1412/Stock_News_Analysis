Greg C. Gantt, President and Chief Executive Officer of Old Dominion, commented, “Old Dominion produced fourth quarter financial results that allowed us to finish the year with Company records for annual revenue and profitability. The results for both the quarter and the year reflect a continued focus on the consistent execution of our long-term strategic plan. This plan revolves around our ability to provide superior service at a fair price while also ensuring that we have sufficient capacity to support our anticipated growth. As a result, we have created an unmatched value proposition in our industry that helped us achieve over $1 billion of revenue growth for the second straight year in 2022.

“Our revenue growth in the fourth quarter included a 16.7% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight, which more than offset the decrease in LTL tons. LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 8.7% and reflects the continued execution of our long-term pricing initiatives. As part of our pricing philosophy, we focus on continuously improving the profitability of each customer account through yield increases that are designed to offset our cost inflation and support further investments in our capacity and technology. We must continue to provide our customers with superior service to support this approach, however, and we were proud to deliver 99% on-time service during the fourth quarter with a cargo claims ratio of 0.1%.

“The operating ratio for the fourth quarter improved 240 basis points to 71.2% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. We continued to operate efficiently during the quarter, despite the decline in volumes, and we also continued our diligent approach to managing our discretionary spending. Our salaries, wages and benefit costs as a percent of revenue improved to 44.0% from 46.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, and our purchased transportation costs decreased 200 basis points to 1.9% of revenue. The combination of these improvements more than offset the increase in operating supplies and expenses as a percent of revenue that primarily resulted from the significant increase in the cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products during the quarter.”

Cash Flow and Use of Capital

Old Dominion’s net cash provided by operating activities was $361.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 and $1.7 billion for the year. The Company had $186.3 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022.

Capital expenditures were $270.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 and $775.1 million for the year. The Company expects its aggregate capital expenditures for 2023 to total approximately $800 million, including planned expenditures of $300 million for real estate and service center expansion projects; $400 million for tractors and trailers; and $100 million for information technology and other assets.

Old Dominion continued to return capital to shareholders during the fourth quarter of 2022 through its share repurchase and dividend programs. For the year, the cash utilized for shareholder return programs included $1.3 billion of share repurchases and $134.5 million of cash dividends.

Increase to Quarterly Cash Dividend

The Company's Board of Directors has declared a first-quarter dividend of $0.40 per share, payable on March 15, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2023. This dividend represents a 33.3% increase to the quarterly cash dividend paid in the first quarter of 2022.

Summary

Mr. Gantt concluded, “Old Dominion’s record-breaking results in 2022 reflect the strength of our team and their unwavering commitment to provide our customers with superior service. While we have recently announced the transition to our next President and Chief Executive Officer, I can proudly assure you that our entire team will remain fully committed to executing the same strategic plan that has helped us produce profitable growth over the long term. There will be no change in our commitment to service nor will we change our approach of investing in our service center network, our technology and, most importantly, our OD Family of employees. With our ongoing and steadfast commitment to the core principles that have differentiated us in the marketplace, we are confident that we can continue to win market share and increase shareholder value.”
