Global Truck Markets

“Good freight markets and an increased fleet age are driving strong demand for fuel-efficient Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks. Class 8 truck industry retail sales in the U.S. and Canada were 283,500 units in 2022. Kenworth and Peterbilt achieved market share of 29.8% in 2022 compared to 29.2% in 2021,” said Darrin Siver, PACCAR executive vice president. “The new Kenworth T680 and Peterbilt 579 vehicles provide customers with up to 7% increased fuel efficiency, which enhances their operating performance and benefits the environment.” U.S. and Canada Class 8 truck industry retail sales are estimated to be in a range of 270,000-310,000 trucks in 2023.

“European truck demand was strong in 2022 due to good European economic growth,” said Harald Seidel, DAF president. “DAF achieved record above 16-tonne market share of 17.3% in 2022, compared to 15.9% in 2021, demonstrating the success of the new generation DAF XG+, XG, XF and XD trucks.” European above 16-tonne truck industry registrations were 297,500 trucks in 2022. It is estimated that European truck industry registrations in the above 16-tonne market in 2023 will be in the range of 270,000-310,000 trucks.

The new DAF XD truck earned the International Truck of the Year 2023 award, as judged by an independent jury of leading European transportation journalists. Harald Seidel, DAF president, commented, “The new DAF XD truck represents a new generation of distribution and vocational vehicles. The versatile DAF XD is available as a tractor or rigid truck with a high performance PACCAR engine. DAF also introduced the DAF XDC truck, which is designed specifically for construction and vocational segments and features two-, three- or four-axle configurations with single or double drive axles.” DAF is the only truck manufacturer to introduce a new generation of trucks fully utilizing the new European regulations for truck masses and dimensions, resulting in a range of highly attractive and aerodynamic trucks which feature industry-leading fuel efficiency, safety and a luxurious cab for driver comfort.

The South American above 16-tonne truck market was 138,300 vehicles in 2022, and is projected to be in the range of 125,000-135,000 trucks in 2023. DAF Brasil achieved a record 6.9% market share in the Brasil above 16-tonne market in 2022, compared to 5.7% in 2021.
