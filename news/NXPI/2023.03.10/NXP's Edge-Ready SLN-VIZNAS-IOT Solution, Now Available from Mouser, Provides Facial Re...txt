Mouser Electronics, Inc., the industry's leading New Product Introduction (NPI) distributor with the widest selection of semiconductors and electronic components, is now stocking the SLN-VIZN3D-IOT development kit for facial recognition from NXP Semiconductors.The SLN-VIZNAS-IOT enables developers to quickly and easily add facial recognition with 3D liveness detection to their products, particularly in the smart home and security markets.NXP's SLN-VIZN3D-IOT development kit leverages a high-performance 3D structured light module (SLM) camera combined with the i.MX RT117F crossover processor to deliver the performance and security of facial recognition with 3D Liveness detection at the edge. This edge-ready solution addresses the privacy concerns and latency associated with cloud-based implementations.The SLN-VIZN3D-IOT delivers reliable 3D facial recognition in indoor and outdoor applications across varied lighting conditions, including bright sunlight, dim night light, or other difficult lighting conditions that are challenging for traditional facial recognition systems. Using a 3D SLM camera enables advanced liveness detection, helping distinguish a real person from spoofing techniques, such as a photograph, imitator mask or a 3D model, to prevent unauthorized access.The SLN-VIZN3D-IOT development kit features fully integrated turnkey software for quick out-of-the-box operation, minimizing time to market, risk, and development effort. The development kit also includes remote registration capability, allowing end-users to register their faces from mobile devices.As a global authorised distributor, Mouser offers the world's widest selection of the newest semiconductors and electronic components - in stock and ready to ship.
