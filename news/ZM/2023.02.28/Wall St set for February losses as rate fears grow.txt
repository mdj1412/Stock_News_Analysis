main U.S. indexes were set for monthly losses on Tuesday as
Treasury yields rose with investors bracing for the possibility
of interest rates remaining high for a prolonged period.Wall Street indexes witnessed a volatile February after a
strong performance at the start of the year as signs of strength
in the U.S. economy and elevated inflation spurred worries that
the Fed will stick to its hawkish policy for longer.The blue-chip Dow slid on Tuesday as Goldman Sachs
fell 2.5% after Chief Executive David Solomon said the
bank is considering "strategic alternatives" for its consumer
business, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq stayed afloat."It just boils down to the expectations in markets that
there is more work that the Federal Reserve will have to do as
far as taking rates higher and keeping them there for a longer
period of time is concerned," said Keith Buchanan, portfolio
manager at GLOBALT Investments."Three or four weeks ago there was an expectation of one
or possibly even two federal cuts this year and that has been
completely priced out of markets."Traders have started to price in the chances of a bigger 50
basis-point rate hike in March, although the odds remain low at
about 23%, according to Fed fund futures, which suggest rates
peaking at 5.4% by September, up from 4.57% now.BofA Global Research warned the Fed could even hike interest
rates to nearly 6%.The yield on two-year Treasury notes, which
tracks investors' expectations of the path of interest rates,

hit in the previous session.Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, a voter in the
