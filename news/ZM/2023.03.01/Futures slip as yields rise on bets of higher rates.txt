Wall Street on Monday found some reprieve from the heavy selloff last week that had pushed the major benchmarks to their biggest weekly percentage declines of the year.The gains, however, were not enough to reverse monthly losses for the three main indexes, with the blue-chip Dow in the red for the year after strong economic data suggested the Federal Reserve could keep interest rates higher for longer.Traders are beginning to price in the possibility of a bigger 50 basis-point rate hike in March, although the odds remain low at about 23%, according to Fed fund futures, which also suggest rates peaking at 5.4% by September, up from 4.57% now. The yield on two-year Treasury notes, which track investors' expectations of the path of interest rates, rose to 4.8%, trading just below a near four-month high hit in the previous session."It's a yield story.

Markets still seem to think that we're going to get rate cuts sometime in the next 12 months and the evidence just does not support that."Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, a voter in the rate-setting committee this year, will speak later in the day.
