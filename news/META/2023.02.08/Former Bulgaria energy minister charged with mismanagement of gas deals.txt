SOFIA, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Bulgarian investigators charged
former energy minister Alexander Nikolov on Wednesday with
mismanagement that led to losses of more than 88 million levs
($48.36 million) at state gas firm Bulgargaz, related to Russia
cutting off gas supplies to the country.Russia cut the gas supplies on which Bulgaria was almost
fully reliant at the end of April 2022 after the European Union
country refused to pay for deliveries in roubles.Nikolov failed to properly supervise the former head of
Bulgaria's public gas supplier Bulgargaz, Ludmil Yotsov, who is
also charged with mismanagement, a spokesperson for Bulgaria's
National Investigative Service told reporters."The former minister of energy is accused of failing to
exercise sufficient controls over the former chief executive of
Bulgargaz in connection with inaction to ensure the operational
activities of Bulgargaz," the spokesperson told reporters."As a result, Bulgargaz incurred damages of 88 million levs
from the end of April and May," the spokesperson said without
elaborating.Former deputy energy minister Danail Nikolov has been
charged with malfeasance as part of the same probe.The spokesperson said the probe was ongoing with
investigators looking into how Bulgaria had formed its official
position on the payment scheme proposed by Russia's Gazprom
and other activities linked to gas supplies last
spring.Nikolov denied any wrongdoing and told reporters that during
his time in office from December 2021 to August 2022 the public
interest was fully respected."The essence of the charges lies in the fact that Bulgaria
refused to bend to the Russian blackmail," he wrote on his
Facebook page.Reuters was unable to immediately contact Ludmil Yotsov and
Danail Nikolov for comment.The centre-right GERB party has accused the former
government of reformist Kiril Petkov of paying higher prices to
secure alternative gas supplies after it refused to pay for
Russian gas in roubles.Bulgargaz initially secured replacement natural gas imports
mainly from neighbouring Greece.Petkov's coalition government, where Nikolov was energy
minister, was toppled in ano-confidence votesix months after taking office in December 2021.In a statement on Wednesday, Petkov's anti-corruption We
Continue the Change party, a key rival of GERB ahead of new snap
polls in April, decried the charges and said Nikolov was accused
for following European Commission's recommendations on how to
proceed with the contract with Gazprom.The party reiterated it had refused to bend to the Russian
pressure and had secured two shipments of liquefied natural gas
at prices equal to those under the contract with Gazprom.($1 = 1.8196 leva)
