In a Facebook post, Muhyiddin also denied a news report that he was arrested on Wednesday. Muhyiddin did not say why he has been called in by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC).  Muhyiddin was prime minister for 17 months between 2020 and 2021. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who came to power in November, last year ordered a review of government projects worth billions of dollars approved by Muhyiddin, including COVID-19 relief programmes, alleging they did not follow proper procedures.Muhyiddin has denied the accusations, describing them as political vendetta.
