One of the prisoners was arrested "without incident" in Missouri on Friday while the other four were located "hours later" in Ohio," the St. Francois County Sheriff's Department said Saturday in a statement on Facebook."As of this morning, all escaped inmates have been located and taken into custody," said police.Last week, authorities mounted a manhunt after the five fugitives broke out of the St. Francois County Detention Center in Farmington, about 75 miles (121 km) south of St. Louis, on Tuesday. To escape, the men entered a secured cell and forced their way through a secured door, authorities said, then climbed on to the detention facility's roof and climbed down to the ground.The inmates walked for about 15 minutes until they entered a secured parking lot where they stole a grey 2009 Scion TC with temporary tags, according to authorities. Three of the prisoners - LuJuan Tucker, Aaron Sebastian and Kelly McSean - are known sex offenders and were being held for crimes committed while in prison. The two others - identified by police as Dakota Pace and Michael Wilkins - were being held on felony warrants. (Reporting by Maria Caspani, Editing by Nick Zieminski)
