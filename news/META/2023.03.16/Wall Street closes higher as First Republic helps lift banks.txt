and Morgan Stanley, confirmed earlier reports
they would deposit up to $30 billion into First Republic Bank's

is considered a more mainstream bank."Shares of JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley were up 1.94% and
1.89% respectively, while the lifeline buoyed First Republic

for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week,
pointing to continued labor market strength, which could
persuade the Fed to keep raising rates further.Weak retail sales figures, as well as data showing a

concluding on March 22.Money markets are still largely pricing in a 25-basis-point
rate hike by the Fed at its March 22 policy announcement.
