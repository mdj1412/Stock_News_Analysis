indexes extend gains on Thursday, after media reports said some
of the country's largest lenders were in talks to aid First
Republic Bank.The latest twist in the regional banks saga came on the
heels of a 50 basis point rate hike by the European Central
Bank, which earlier in the day had dampened investor sentiment
already hurt by fears of a banking crisis.Financial institutions, including JP Morgan Chase & Co
and Morgan Stanley, stood ready to deposit up to
$30 billion into First Republic Bank's coffers to stabilize the
lender, according to several reports, including Reuters sources."Banks are looking out for one another," said Huntington
Private Bank chief investment officer, John Augustine."We had two outliers go down and now they want to save what
is considered a more mainstream bank."Shares of JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley were up 1.62% and
1.87% respectively, while the possibility of a rescue buoyed
First Republic Bank, which gained 10.72%.The positive sentiment spread to other regional lenders,
with Alliance Bancorp and PacWest Bancorp
advancing 12.21% and 0.26%, respectively, after opening in the
red.The KBW regional banking index gained 3.32%, while
the S&P 500 banking index advanced 1.65%, as both
sub-indexes reversed losses.Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the
U.S. banking system remains sound and Americans can feel
confident that their deposits will be there when needed.U.S.-listed shares of Credit Suisse ticked 2.55%
higher after the bank secured a credit line of up to $54 billion
from the Swiss National Bank to shore up liquidity and investor
confidence.Data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for
unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week,
pointing to continued labor market strength, which could
persuade the Fed to keep raising rates further.Weak retail sales figures, as well as data showing a
downward trend in producer inflation, on Wednesday had bolstered
bets of a small rate hike by the Federal Reserve at its meet
concluding on March 22.Money markets are still largely pricing in a 25-basis-point
rate hike by the Fed in March..The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 268.11 points,
or 0.84%, to 32,142.68, the S&P 500 gained 51.23 points,

225.66 points, or 1.97%, to 11,659.71.Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Snapchat
operator Snap Inc rose 0.59% and 7.35%, respectively,
after the U.S. administration threatened to impose a ban on
TikTok.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a
2.45-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.83-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 3 new 52-week highs and 22 new lows; the
Nasdaq Composite recorded 29 new highs and 207 new lows.
