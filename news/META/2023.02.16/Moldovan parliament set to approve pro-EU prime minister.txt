Recean, 48, was nominated on Friday by President Maia Sandu to replace ex-prime minister Natalia Gavrilita whose government resigned last week after a turbulent 18 months in office overshadowed by Russia's war in Ukraine.Recean, a former interior minister, was expected to secure the approval of the 101-seat parliament after outlining his policy plans as Moldova faces economic turmoil and alleged Russian meddling."We want to live in a safe world where international treaties are respected, where problems between countries are resolved through dialogue, where there is respect for small states," his proposed government said in its draft programme."We want to be full members of the European Union," it added.Moldova already has the status of candidate to join the EU but the process usually takes several years. Its economy has been hit by the spillover effects of Russia's invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, with high energy and food prices driving consumer inflation sharply higher in 2022 and a large number of displaced persons arriving from Ukraine.Sandu, whose country of 2.5 million people is heavily dependent on Russian gas flows, accused Moscow on Monday of plotting to topple Moldova's leadership, stop the country joining the EU and use it in the war against Ukraine. Russia, which has troops in Moldova's breakaway Transdniestria region, denied the allegation.Recean said his planned government would include only four new ministers who were not been in the old one. They included the ministers for finance, infrastructure, justice and energy, he wrote on Facebook. Sandu's political party holds a majority of 63 seats in parliament, easily enough to secure the 51 votes required to approve a new government.Recean is an experienced politician who has held a number of senior positions in Moldova's government and has also been serving as secretary of the Supreme Security Council. He was interior minister from 2012 to 2015 under two prime ministers, and was the first civilian to hold the post. (Writing by Tom Balmforth, Editing by Timothy Heritage)By Alexander Tanas
