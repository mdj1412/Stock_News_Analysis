after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress the
central bank will likely need to raise interest rates more than
expected as it seeks to rein in stubbornly high inflation.Equities lost ground right after Powell's prepared remarks
were released ahead of his testimony and sank further as the
session wore on. Powell told U.S. lawmakers the Fed is prepared
to move in larger steps if economic data suggests tougher
measures are needed to control rising prices.The remarks were his first since data showed inflation
unexpectedly jumped in January and the U.S. government reported
an unusually large increase in payroll jobs for the month.Traders dramatically raised their bets of a 50-basis-point
rate hike in March after Powell's comments, with money market
futures pricing a more than 65% chance of such a move, up from
31% before the remarks, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.The idea of higher rates for longer is a headwind and
"hearing it directly from Powell is a little different to
inferring it from the data," said Chris Zaccarelli, chief
investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance.But some money managers say investors should have been
expecting Powell's hawkish tone."The bear market rally that began in October has been
supported by hope over reality. Fed Chair Powell's comments
today should come as no surprise to investors," said John Lynch,
chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management, in an
email."Employment and consumption have been strong, while the
easy gains in the battle against inflation have been made."The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 559.16
points, or 1.67%, to 32,872.28, the S&P 500 lost 61.78
points, or 1.53%, to 3,986.64 and the Nasdaq Composite
dropped 136.86 points, or 1.17%, to 11,538.88.All 11 major S&P sectors were in the red, led by
economically sensitive financials with a 2.5% drop.
Declining least was the consumer discretionary index,
down 0.99%.Powell, who will testify again on Wednesday before the House
of Representatives Financial Services Committee, also added that
the Fed will not consider changing its 2% inflation target and
the job market does not suggest an economic downturn was close.Data the Fed will use to influence its rate hiking path
will include Friday's non-farm payroll numbers. Economists
polled by Reuters are expecting an increase of 200,000 jobs in
February, compared with the much stronger-than-expected 517,000
jobs reported in January."A 50 bps hike in the next meeting is possible, but it is
going to be dependent on the payrolls not slowing down and CPI
numbers showing that the disinflation progress we've made is
stalling," said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at
Horizon Investments.Meanwhile, the yield on two-year Treasury notes,
which best reflects short-term rate expectations, hit 5% for the
first time since July 2007.Rising bond yields tend to weigh on equity valuations,
particularly those of growth and technology stocks, as higher
rates reduce the value of future cash flows.Big individual stock moves included a 12% decline for Rivian
Automotive after the electric automaker unveiled plans
to sell bonds worth $1.3 billion.Dick's Sporting Goods was up 9.6% after the retailer
forecast annual earnings above Wall Street estimates and more
than doubled its quarterly dividend.Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a
3.71-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.13-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&P 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and seven new
lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 45 new highs and 122 new
lows.(Reporting by Sin√©ad Carew in New York, Sruthi Shankar and
