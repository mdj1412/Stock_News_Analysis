Meta and Dfinity asked the court Monday to dismiss the case with prejudice, which means it cannot be revived.Representatives for the parties did not immediately respond to requests for more information on Tuesday.Switzerland-based Dfinity's Internet Computer is an "infinite" public blockchain network designed to host smart contracts. Dfinity sued Meta last year, alleging the logo Meta adopted after changing its name from Facebook would cause confusion with Dfinity's infinity-symbol trademarks.Meta has described its logo as a "continuous loop" that resembles both the letter 'M' and an infinity sign to symbolize "infinite horizons in the metaverse."U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed Dfinity's original complaint in November but allowed the company to amend the lawsuit. Breyer said Meta's logo was unlikely to cause consumer confusion, citing differences in the logos' designs and the fact that Dfinity's customers are "tech-savvy developers."Dfinity filed an amended complaint in December.Meta is still facing trademark lawsuits from virtual-reality company MetaX and investment firm Metacapital over its name change.The case is Dfinity Foundation v.
