March 9 (Reuters) - Meta executives on Thursday
acknowledged that the company was catching up from behind on
infrastructure capacity for artificial intelligence, saying they
had been "little bit late" to the trend of deploying graphics
processing units, or GPUs."We were a little bit late to the trends, so we're playing a
little bit of catch-up" after years of optimizing for CPUs, said
Chief Operating Officer Javier Olivan, speaking at a Morgan
Stanley conference.
