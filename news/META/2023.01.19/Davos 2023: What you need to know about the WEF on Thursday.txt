DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 19 (Reuters) - All eyes were on
Greta Thunberg on Thursday as she called on the global energy
industry and its financiers to end all fossil fuel investments
at a high-profile meeting in Davos with Fatih Birol, the head of
the International Energy Agency (IEA).During the round-table, she and three of her fellow
activists said they had presented a "cease and desist" letter to
CEOs calling for a stop to new oil, gas and coal extraction."As long as they can get away with it they will continue to
invest in fossil fuels, they will continue to throw people under
the bus," Thunberg warned.That message seemed to have got through to Britain's
opposition leader Keir Starmer, who said there would be no
investment in new oil and gas fields in Britain if the Labour
arty is elected to govern, which would mark a big change from
the country's current energy policies."What we've said about oil and gas is that there does need
to be a transition," he said.While much of the talk at and around the annual World
Economic Forum (WEF) meeting has been about the urgent need to
address climate change and the challenges and solutions of the
transition to a low-carbon economy, war in Ukraine has also been
at or near the top of the agenda.As Kyiv attempts to secure more modern arms from its allies,
it has stepped up a parallel effort to lock in financial support
from business leaders in Davos to help rebuild the country.Since Russia invaded Ukraine last year, the United States
and its allies have given tens of billions of dollars' worth of
weaponry, but Kyiv is still desperate for more, and keen to ride
a wave of Western public support to ensure that pledges for its
reconstruction are more than just words.Ukraine, which dominated the WEFs last big meeting in May,
has again sent dozens of executives, lawmakers and decision
makers with a clear message from President Volodymyr Zelenskiy:
commit now, not later.Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson lent his
support, urging allies to double down on sending military
equipment to support Ukraine."The best thing for the world is to get this thing done, and
done fast," Johnson said in an interview as part of the Reuters
Impact Arctic Warning series.ChatGPT has also been a hot topic of conversation.Generative artificial intelligence, the umbrella technology
behind the popular chatbot technology, has interesting
applications for social media, Chris Cox, the chief product
officer for Facebook parent Meta, told Reuters.He said that such technology has the capability to create
image filters for apps like Instagram. Meta has been working on
generative AI research, for instance tech that can convert a
text prompt into a video clip.For daily Davos updates in your inbox sign up for the
