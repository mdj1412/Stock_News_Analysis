MELBOURNE, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Malaysian regulators
renewed an operating license for Lynas Rare Earths'
unit, the Australian company said on Tuesday, but they retained
conditions that will prevent Lynas from importing and processing
rare earths concentrate after July 1.Lynas, the world's biggest producer of rare earths outside
China, will need to close the cracking and leaching part of its
rare earths processing plant if the conditions are not removed
before then, it said in a securities filing to the stock
exchange.Malaysia's government has raised concerns about radiation
levels from the process of cracking and leaching."Lynas is not allowed to carry out any activities that
will produce radioactive waste in Malaysia after July 2023,"
Malaysia's Science, Technology and Innovation Minister Chang Lih
Kang said in a statement on Facebook on Tuesday.But two International Atomic Energy Agency reviews found
the plant to be low risk and compliant with relevant
regulations, Lynas noted.The decision raises the prospect of an interruption to
supply of neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr) which are used in
magnets as crucial components of everything from iPhones to
weapons systems, later this year.“After 10 years of safe operation in Malaysia we are
disappointed that the conditions that were applied to our 2020
operating licence remain," Chief Executive Amanda Lacaze said in
the statement.“We will now proceed with administrative and legal appeals
to ensure that Lynas is treated fairly and equitably as a
Foreign Direct Investor and a significant employer and
contributor to the Malaysian economy."Under its new permit, Lynas will be able to continue other
parts of processing until March 2026.Lynas had applied to Malaysia's regulator for the conditions
to be removed because they "represent a significant variation
from the conditions under which... Lynas made the initial
decision to invest in Malaysia," it said.The decision puts a greater focus on the construction
timeline for Lynas' cracking and leaching facility in central
Australia, broker Canaccord said in a report, with Lynas able to
use stockpiles for a time if the plant is not ready by July 1.Lynas ships rare earths concentrate to Malaysia from its
Mount Weld operations in Central Australia where it is building
the processing plant in the town of Kalgoorlie to add capacity
and mitigate Malaysia's regulatory risk."After the market fully digests this news, we see investor
focus return to the significant long-term value LYC offers, its
strategic asset base and market leading position (ex China) in
the NdPr market," Canaccord said, maintaining its buy rating.Lynas shares traded up 2.5% at A$8.50 ($5.92) on Tuesday
after falling as much as 8.2% on the previous day after a news
report at the weekend suggested its operating licence would not
be approved.
