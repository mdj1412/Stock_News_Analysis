"Much ink has been spilled about Lina Khan's attempts to remake federal antitrust law as chairman of the Federal Trade Commission," Wilson wrote in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal. "Less has been said about her disregard for the rule of law and due process and the way senior FTC officials enable her." An FTC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the allegations.The commission should have five members but will now have just Khan, as chair, and commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. All are Democrats.Wilson said in the piece that she would "soon resign" but did not give a date.Wilson said Khan has been responsible for "abuses of power," such as voting to challenge Meta Platforms Inc's  acquisition of virtual reality content maker Within. Wilson argued that Khan had said before coming to the FTC that Meta should not be able to make additional acquisitions, and that this meant Khan should be recused from FTC deliberations regarding the deal."I dissented on due-process grounds, which require those sitting in a judicial capacity to avoid even the appearance of unfairness," wrote Wilson.
