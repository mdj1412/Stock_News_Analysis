Jan 23 (Reuters) - Annual inflation at 14-year highs in
the Philippines will likely ease to below 4% by the third
quarter and then 2% by early next year, as aggressive tightening
and supply-side intervention take root, its central bank
governor said on Monday."We expect to be very successful in bringing down
inflation," Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Felipe Medalla
told an investment forum in Frankfurt.Medalla said the high inflation was fuelled by supply
shocks, so the government's plan to speed up importation of
certain commodities like onion and sugar, on top of tighter
policy, should help tackle soaring prices.President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who is also agriculture
minister, said he was determined to slow the pace of inflation,
which last month quickened to a fresh 14-year high of 8.1%."What I lose sleep every night over is how to bring down
inflation," he said in interview shown on the Facebook page of
state-controlled PTV.Marcos recently approved the emergency importation of onions
to address skyrocketing prices that have contributed to
inflation, but said it would take a while before the measure
would have an impact.Retail prices of onions surged to as high as 700 pesos
($12.83) per kilogramme in recent days in Manila markets, among
the highest in the world, according to some economists.Food prices helped push the consumer price index last month
up 8.1% from a year earlier, the fastest rise in 14 years,
bringing full-year average inflation to 5.8%, outside the
central bank's 2%-4% target range.BSP's Medalla has signalled further interest rates hikes at
the central bank's first two policy meetings this year to bring
inflation back within a target range of 2% to 4%.The BSP, which raised its benchmark interest rate
by a total of 350 basis points last year, will hold
its first policy meeting of 2023 on Feb. 16.
