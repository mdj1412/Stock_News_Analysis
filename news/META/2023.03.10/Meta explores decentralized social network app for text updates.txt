Indian business news website Moneycontrol.com first reported the news, citing sources. The report said that Meta's new content app would support ActivityPub, the decentralized social networking protocol that powers Twitter-rival Mastodon."We're exploring a standalone decentralized social network for sharing text updates. We believe there's an opportunity for a separate space where creators and public figures can share timely updates about their interests," a Meta spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement.
