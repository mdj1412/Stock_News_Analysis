*Ukraine's GDP fell 30.4% in 2022 - preliminary data*Decline is less than had been expected*Russian invasion means uncertainty and risks remain highKYIV, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Ukraine suffered its sharpest
economic decline in over 30 years in 2022 because of the war
with Russia, but said foreign aid and the "unbreakable spirit"
of its people helped prevent an even worse scenario.Preliminary economy ministry data on Thursday showed a 30.4%
drop in gross domestic product last year and economic analysts
said risks and uncertainty remain high, especially if Russia
continues to attack critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko described the decline in
GDP as the biggest in any year since Ukraine won independence
from the Soviet Union in 1991, but said the fall was smaller
than expected."In 2022, the Ukrainian economy suffered its largest losses
and damages in the entire history of independence, inflicted on
it by the Russian Federation," Svyrydenko, who is also first
deputy prime minister, said in a statement."The successes of Ukraine's defence forces on the front
lines, the coordinated work of the government and businesses,
the unbreakable spirit of the population and the speed of
rebuilding damaged critical infrastructure units, and also
systemic financial support from international donors have
allowed us to keep up the economic front and continue our
movement towards victory."The war has caused widespread death and destruction,
uprooted millions of Ukrainians, disrupted agriculture, limited
access to the Black Sea ports that are vital for grain and
metals exports, and driven up defence spending.Ukraine's economy is export-led, but exports have slumped
since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. The economy ministry said this
week that exports had fallen 35% compared with 2021, and
physical volumes fell by 38.4% this year.Ukraine is a major global grain producer and exporter. Grain
exports have fallen sharply since the invasion, with some
seaports blocked by Russia, but again accounted for the bulk of
the country's exports in 2022.DELIVERING THE 'IMPOSSIBLE'Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said in December that the
economy could shrink by up to 50% in 2022 if Russia kept
attacking critical infrastructure.Ukraine's ICU investment house said the country's economy
had delivered the impossible."Similar to the Ukrainian army on the battlefield, the
Ukrainian economy defied the worst expectations of collapse and
has managed to rapidly adjust to new realities," it said in a
research note.Ukraine's economic decline slowed in the latter months of
2022 after Russian retreats in some southern areas of Ukraine
including the Kherson region.GDP fell by 34% in December after a 37% fall in November,
according to the economy ministry's preliminary data.Foreign aid is set to remain of critical importance to
Ukraine's financial stability and economy. Government officials
have said Ukraine received about $31 billion in foreign grants
and loans in 2022.The country's budget deficit in 2023  is planned at $38
billion, and the government plans to cover it with foreign aid."International partners are ready to support us not only
with arms but with money. It is critically important to maintain
macro-financial stability," Olena Bilan, chief economist for
Dragon Capital investment bank, said on her Facebook page.Analysts said the risks for 2023 include Russian missile
attacks on energy facilities and other infrastructure that since
mid-October have caused major power outages and shortages."We do not expect a notable economic recovery in 2023,
because of weak internal demand and considerable limits in
export logistics," ICU said.Dragon Capital investment bank expects Ukraine's economy to
fall by 5 percent this year. Ukraine's GDP grew by 3.4% in 2021.
