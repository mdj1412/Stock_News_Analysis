The owner of photo messaging app Snapchat is the first of the major digital advertising platforms to report quarterly results, which often provide an early signal for platforms like Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc and Alphabet's Google, which report results this week.In a letter to investors, Snap said a weakening economy, increased competition from other social media platforms and "platform policy changes" continued to hurt its business.Apple began rolling out privacy changes on iPhones in 2021 that have limited advertisers' ability to collect data for targeted advertising. "We expect the headwinds we have faced over the past year to persist throughout Q1," the company said in a letter to investors.Snap's net loss was $288 million during the quarter, down from net income of $23 million the previous year. Revenue for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 was $1.3 billion, flat from the prior-year quarter and in line with analyst expectations. Snap will host an investor day on Feb. 16 to detail its plan to move forward after announcing in August that it would lay off 20% of its staff and discontinue experimental projects like a drone camera to cut costs.The tech sector has been hammered in recent months amid record-high inflation and expectations of a recession.
