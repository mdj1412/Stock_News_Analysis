(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London opened lower on Wednesday, but the pound was on the rise, after inflation in the UK came in hotter than expected in February, remaining in double-digits.The FTSE 100 index opened down 15.66 points, or 0.2%, at 7,519.06. The FTSE 250 was down 95.05 points, or 0.5%, at 18,682.71, and the AIM All-Share was down 0.67 of a point, or 0.1%, at 804.29.The Cboe UK 100 was down 0.3% at 751.94, the Cboe UK 250 was down 0.6% at 16,261.18, and the Cboe Small Companies was down 0.3% at 16,261.18.The consumer price index rose by 10.4% in February from a year before, accelerating from a 10.1% annual rise in January. Market consensus had expected UK inflation to cool to 9.8% in February, according to FXStreet.The print remained below the recent peak of 11.1% in October, which was the highest annual inflation rate since 1981, according to the ONS.Core annual inflation - excluding energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco - picked up to 6.2% in February from 5.8% in January. Markets had expected core inflation to remain unchanged. Nicholas Hyett, investment analyst at Wealth Club, said the print leaves the Bank of England with "unappealing choices". The UK central bank can "ease back on rate rises but risk leaving inflation running higher when households are already struggling, or stay in the inflationary fight and risk further economic crunches." For CMC Market's Michael Hewson, however, Wednesday's data "seals the deal" on a 25 basis point rate rise on Thursday, though he added it may increase pressure on the central bank to go further and consider a 50 basis point move. The Bank of England will announce its interest rate decision at midday on Thursday. Before that, the latest US Federal Reserve decision is due on Wednesday afternoon, with a 25-basis-point hike also expected. Last week, the European Central Bank raised rates by 50 basis points.The pound was quoted at USD1.2274 at early on Wednesday in London, higher compared to USD1.2192 at the close on Tuesday.

UK housebuilder Vistry climbed 3.1% despite reporting a drop in annual profit as it lamented more challenging market conditions in the final quarter of 2022, leading the company to slash its final dividend.

"Until the recent banking issues emerged, this was expected to result in another rise in interest rates. There had even been speculation that after slowing the pace of its hikes to just 25 basis points in February, the Fed may now pick it up again to 50bp. That picture has changed and a 50bp hike now seems unlikely. Indeed, it is possible that the Fed will choose to make no move at all," said analysts at LLoyds Bank. "A 25bp hike is perhaps the most likely outcome but the decision seems to be on a knife edge."According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets believe there is a 86% chance the Federal Reserve will lift US interest rates by 25 basis points, with the remaining 14% expecting rates to stay at their current level. The US Federal Reserve will announce the decision at 1800 GMT. A press conference with Chair Jerome Powell follows half an hour later. The decision comes after a chaotic couple of weeks for the US banking sector, triggered by the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.The collapses caused a crisis of confidence, with many customers of similarly sized banks withdrawing their money and depositing it in larger institutions â€“ considered too big for the government not to bail them out if they faced failure.On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told a lenders' conference that US banking sector is "stabilizing". She said "outflows from regional banks have stabilized" following authorities' moves to shore up confidence and stem contagion.New York ended higher on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 1.0%, the S&P 500 up 1.3% and the Nasdaq Composite up 1.6%.
