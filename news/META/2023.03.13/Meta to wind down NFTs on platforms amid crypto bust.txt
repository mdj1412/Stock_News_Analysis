March 13 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc is
cutting off support for digital collectibles or non-fungible
tokens (NFTs) on its platforms less than a year after rolling it
out, as the crypto market continues to spiral."We're winding down digital collectibles (NFTs) for now
to focus on other ways to support creators, people, and
businesses," the social media firm's fintech head, Stephane
Kasriel, tweeted on Monday.The company rolled out support for creators to share
NFTs on Instagram and Facebook last year, when the speculative
crypto asset had exploded in popularity, with sales of cartoon
apes to video clips touching billions of dollars.But bitcoin and other tokens took a beating in late 2022
after major exchange FTX crashed into sudden bankruptcy.The downfall was worsened by last week's collapse of three
U.S. banks, two of which were crypto-focused."We'll continue investing in fintech tools that people and
businesses will need for the future. We're streamlining payments
w/ Meta Pay, making checkout and payouts easier, and investing
in messaging payments across Meta," Kasriel said.(Reporting by Eva Mathews in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika
