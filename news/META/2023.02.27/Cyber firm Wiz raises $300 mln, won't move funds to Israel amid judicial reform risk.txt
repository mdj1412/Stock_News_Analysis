JERUSALEM, Feb 27 (Reuters) - U.S.-Israeli cyber
security startup Wiz said on Monday it raised $300 million in a
private financing round that takes the firm's valuation to $10
billion, but also said it wouldn't move any of the money to
Israel while there is uncertainty about the judicial system.Plans by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to overhaul the
judicial system, which have sparked nationwide protests on a
scale Israel hasn't seen in years, would give the government
greater sway on selecting judges while limiting the Supreme
Court's power to strike down legislation.Businesses and economists say the planned reforms could harm
Israel as an investment destination. For Israel's tech
companies, an independent legal system is crucial to protecting
their main asset, intellectual property, with some local tech
executives saying they may consider domiciling abroad as a
result of the government's plans."Unfortunately, due to the legal coup the money raised will
not enter Israel," Wiz co-founder and CEO Assaf Rappaport said
in a statement. "Our big concern about Israeli high tech is not
only about money leaving Israel but also the large amount of
money that will no longer enter Israel."Wiz has already moved tens of millions of dollars of funds
out of Israel, sources have said.Since its founding nearly three years ago, Wiz, which
focuses on cloud security and has 650 employees globally, has
raised $900 million from investors, including Sequoia Capital,
Insight Partners, Blackstone and G Squared.The latest late stage round was led by Lightspeed Venture
Partners and existing investors Greenoaks Capital Partners and
Index Ventures.Citing data from Pitchbook, Wiz said it became the
fastest tech firm to reach a $10 billion valuation, ahead of
giants such as Uber and Facebook."Wiz has been successful until today thanks to an
amazing ecosystem that exists in Israel but it is currently
facing existential danger," said Rappaport, calling on the
government to come up with a compromise that is acceptable to
all parties.Wiz, whose customer base is 35% of Fortune 100 companies,
also said it plans to open new offices in the United States in
Austin, Dallas and Washington D.C.
