(Alliance News) - BP PLC on Tuesday said it is constructing a 134 megawatt direct current solar project in Fulton County in the US state of Ohio.For the project, named Arche, the London-based oil major signed a power purchase agreement with the renewable energy unit of Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc. BP added that its 50:50 joint-venture partner, global solar energy company Lightsource bp, developed the project on behalf of BP and manages the construction. Once completed, the project will generate enough energy to power more than 20,000 US homes per year, BP explained. BP said the construction is part of its plan to develop 20 gigawatts of net renewable generating capacity by 2025 and 50 gigawatts by 2030. "At full capacity, Arche's renewable power could avoid more than 155,900 metric tons of greenhouse-gas emissions annually â€“ equivalent to 34,000 fuel-burning cars," BP said.BP shares were 0.5% lower at 477.00 pence each in London on Tuesday afternoon.By Tom Budszus, Alliance News reporterComments and questions to newsroom@alliancenews.comCopyright 2023 Alliance News Ltd.
