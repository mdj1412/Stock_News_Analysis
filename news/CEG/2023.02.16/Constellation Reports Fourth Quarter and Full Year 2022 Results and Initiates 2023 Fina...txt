Constellation Energy Corporation (Nasdaq: CEG) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022.

“We had an incredible first year that exceeded expectations as we adapted to rapidly evolving market conditions, successfully advocated for clean energy policies and positioned the company for sustainable, long-term growth,” said Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation. “I want to emphasize that there is no commodity more valuable to our economy, national security and way of life than energy that is carbon-free, affordable and always there when you need it, and no U.S. company produces more of it than we do. The unique reliability and resiliency of our nuclear fleet was driven home yet again during Winter Storm Elliott, when our operated fleet performed at 100 percent, helping to prevent rolling blackouts on Christmas Eve as fossil generation in our nation’s largest electric grid failed. Nuclear’s value to the grid was also proven in the 2014 polar vortex and again in 2021 during Winter Storm Uri, and it’s only going to increase in the years ahead as we invest to extend the lives of our nuclear plants, increase their output and utilize their carbon-free energy to power the dirtiest parts of our economy with clean hydrogen. We set out one year ago to be the nation’s answer to the climate crisis, and today we have the assets and financial foundation to deliver on that promise.”

“Our strong financial position allows us to return exceptional value to shareholders by doubling our dividend and authorizing a $1 billion share repurchase program, while still leaving us the flexibility to build a new, clean hydrogen business and reserve $2 billion in unallocated capital to invest in other organic and inorganic growth as opportunities arise, or return additional capital to shareholders,” said Dan Eggers, chief financial officer of Constellation. “Operationally, our nuclear fleet remains the most reliable and efficient in the industry and our commercial business delivered high value in a market buffeted by global events. For the year, we delivered $2.667 billion in adjusted EBITDA, which exceeded the top of our range, and we are introducing 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.9 billion to $3.3 billion.”

Our GAAP Net Income for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $34 million, down from $42 million GAAP Net Income in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In analyzing and planning for our business, we supplement our use of net income as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), with Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) as a performance measure. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) reflects an additional way of viewing our business that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation to GAAP net income included above, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures and is, by definition, an incomplete understanding of our business, and must be considered in conjunction with GAAP measures. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) is neither a standardized financial measure, nor a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this press release and earnings release attachments. We have provided the non-GAAP financial measure as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) should not be deemed more useful than, a substitute for, or an alternative to the most comparable GAAP Net Income measure provided in this earnings release and attachments. This press release and earnings release attachments provide reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and are posted on our website: www.ConstellationEnergy.com, and have been furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K on February 16, 2023.
