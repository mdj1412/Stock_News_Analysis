          Non-GAAP Financial Measures
        

          The Registrants report their financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Constellation supplements the reporting of financial information determined in accordance with GAAP with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including:
        


Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and excludes certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items, including mark-to-market adjustments from economic hedging activities and fair value adjustments related to gas imbalances and equity investments, decommissioning related activity, asset impairments, certain amounts associated with plant retirements and divestitures, pension and other post-employment benefits (OPEB) non-service credits, separation related costs and other items as set forth in the Appendix. Includes nuclear fuel amortization expense.
          

Adjusted cash flows from operations primarily includes net cash flows from operating activities and Collection of Deferred Purchase Price (DPP) related to the revolving accounts receivable arrangement, which is presented in cash flows from investing activities under GAAP
          

Free cash flows before growth (FCFbg) is adjusted cash flows from operations less capital expenditures under GAAP for maintenance and nuclear fuel, non-recurring capital expenditures related to separation and Enterprise Resource Program (ERP) system implementation, changes in collateral, net merger and acquisitions, and equity investments and other items as set forth in the Appendix
          

Adjusted operating revenues excludes the mark-to-market impact of economic hedging activities due to the volatility and unpredictability of the future changes in commodity prices
          

Adjusted purchased power and fuel excludes the mark-to-market impact of economic hedging activities and fair value adjustments related to gas imbalances due to the volatility and unpredictability of the future changes in commodity prices
          

Total gross margin is defined as adjusted operating revenues less adjusted purchased power and fuel expense, excluding revenue related to decommissioning, gross receipts tax, JExel Nuclear JV, variable interest entities, and net of direct cost of sales for certain end-user businesses
          

Adjusted operating and maintenance (O&M) excludes direct cost of sales for certain end-user businesses, ARO accretion expense from unregulated units and decommissioning costs that do not affect profit and loss, the impact from operating and maintenance expense related to variable interest entities at Constellation, and other items as set forth in the reconciliation in the Appendix
          


          Due to the forward-looking nature of some forecasted non-GAAP measures, information to reconcile the forecasted adjusted (non-GAAP) measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure may not be available, as management is unable to project all of these items for future periods.
