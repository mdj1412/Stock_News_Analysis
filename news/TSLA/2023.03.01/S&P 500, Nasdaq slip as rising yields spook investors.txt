on Wednesday as Treasury yields surged after manufacturing data
pointed to persistent price pressures, while comments from
Federal Reserve policymakers backed a hawkish policy stance for
a longer period.The yield on 10-year notes topped 4% for the
first time since November after the Institute for Supply
Management's survey showed U.S. manufacturing contracted in
February and prices for raw materials increased last month.The two-year yield, which closely tracks
short-term interest rate expectations, rose to 4.9%, its highest
level since 2007."The 10-year Treasury is up and that is just a natural
headwind to equity valuations," said Matt Stucky, senior
portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management."You also got a tick up in the ISM prices paid, which means
that prices generally are rising now for manufacturing. It just
means that the Federal Reserve is likely to push further into
restrictive territory with their policy and stay there longer."Traders of futures tied to the Fed's policy rate added to
bets that the U.S. central bank will raise its benchmark rate to
a range of 5.5%-5.75% by September, from the current range of
4.5%-4.75%.Adding to worries, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari,
a voter in the rate-setting committee in 2023, said he is
"open-minded" on either a 25 basis point or a 50 basis point
rate hike in March. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said
monetary policy will have to remain tight "until well into
2024".The main U.S. benchmarks had ended February with losses on
expectations that the Fed will increase rates more than
initially thought on signs of resilience in the economy.U.S. monthly payrolls and consumer prices data in the coming
days will further help investors gauge the path of rates ahead
of the March 21-22 meeting, when the Fed is largely seen hiking
rates by 25 basis points.While seven of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors fell, energy
and material indexes climbed nearly 2% as
commodity prices rallied after data showed China's manufacturing
activity expanded at the fastest pace in more than a decade.At 12:13 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 slipped 7.52 points, or
0.19%, to 3,962.63 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 31.85
points, or 0.28% to 11,423.69.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, rose 34.76
points, or 0.11%, to 32,691.46, boosted by Caterpillar Inc
after the construction equipment maker said it had
reached a tentative agreement with a labor union, averting a
possible strike.Tesla Inc slipped 2.4% ahead of its investor day
event. The electric automaker is readying a production revamp of
its top-selling Model Y, Reuters reported, citing people
familiar with the plan.Novavax Inc slumped 26.4% after the COVID-19
vaccine maker raised doubts about its ability to remain in
business and announced plans to slash spending as it prepares
for a fall vaccination campaign.Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.13-to-1 ratio
on the NYSE and 1.07-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The S&P index recorded eight new 52-week highs and 12 new
lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 63 new highs and 88 new lows.
