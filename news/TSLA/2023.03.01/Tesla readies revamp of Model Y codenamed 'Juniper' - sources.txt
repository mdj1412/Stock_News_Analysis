SHANGHAI/SAN FRANCISCO, March 1 (Reuters) - Tesla
is readying a production revamp of its top-selling
Model Y, according to three people with knowledge of the plan.The changes to the Model Y â€“ code-named Project Juniper -
involve the exterior and interior of the electric vehicle (EV)
with a target of starting production in 2024, according to two
of the people, who asked not to be identified because the
planning remains private.A revamp of the Model Y would mean Tesla is on track to
offer new versions of its top-selling models over the next two
years, addressing pressure in markets like China and the United
States for a visible reboot of its best-selling vehicles in the
face of increasing options for EV buyers.Tesla did not immediately comment when asked by Reuters
about the plans for the Model Y, a crossover EV which was its
best seller in California, China and Europe last year.At Tesla's investor day, CEO Elon Musk and other executives
declined to discuss specifics of new models.Tesla has already been working to retool its Shanghai
assembly plant to prepare for a revamped version of its Model 3
sedan in a project codenamed Highland, Reuters has reported.A revamp of the Model Y, first delivered to customers in
2020, would mean production and supply changes for a car now in
production across all of Tesla's major hubs: the United States,
China and Germany."With the Model Y being not only being Tesla's top seller,
but also the top-selling EV in the world, it's important to keep
it fresh," AutoPacific president and chief analysts Ed Kim said,
adding that he had been tracking Project Juniper."As the global EV sales leader, Model Y has a target on its
back," Kim said. "As with Project Highland, Project Juniper
should deepen Tesla's already massive production cost advantages
over the competition."PROJECT JUNIPERMusk and other executives detailed efforts to take costs out
of EV manufacturing during Tesla's investor day.Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn said the factory
layout for Model Y production varied across the three plants
that make the car and that Tesla would work to standardize
planning for future vehicles to reduce costs and complexity.Musk declined to comment on the specifics of any future
models but said Tesla could look to address the variants of
Model Y it currently sells."But, broadly speaking, the most profound architectural
changes will be in future vehicles," Musk said, in response to
an investor question.Tesla has asked suppliers for quotes for exterior and
interior components that will be used in the Project Juniper
version of the Model Y, two of the people with knowledge of the
plan said.The projected start of production is October 2024, according
to one of the people.It was not immediately clear how sweeping the revamp would
be or what specific changes or improvements Tesla was looking to
deliver with the new Model Y.HIGHLAND MODEL 3The Highland version of the Model 3 is expected to go into
production in Shanghai in September, according to a person with
knowledge of the matter.With Highland, Tesla is aiming to cut production costs and
boost the appeal of an electric sedan that first went on sale in
2017, people involved in the project have said. There will also
be changes to the exterior and powertrain performance with a
focus on production efficiency, they said.The leading EV maker has faced increasing competitive
pressure in China, its second-largest market behind the United
States, even after it cut prices.Analysts have said that is in part because it has been seen
as lagging competitors in introducing new models, improved
navigation or luxe interior touches that car shoppers in the
world's largest EV market are seeking.In contrast to legacy automakers, which have tended to make
incremental model-year changes before introducing an all-new
version, Tesla has pressed the pace of change in its EVs.Tesla has made frequent changes to its EVs through software
updates and sometimes through hardware changes to add features,
improve performance or cut production costs, analysts have said.In one example, Tesla announced on Wednesday it had made
changes in the suspension system on the Model Y made in China
since January to make the ride smoother, an update Tesla fans
applauded on social media.Tesla's plant near Berlin hit a new production record
equivalent to annual output of over 200,000 Model Ys earlier
this week, the company said. That was three weeks ahead of an
internal production target reviewed by Reuters.
