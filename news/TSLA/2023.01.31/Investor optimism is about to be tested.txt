Caterpillar maker missed quarterly earnings due to higher manufacturing costs, while McDonald's warned of short-term inflationary pressures and Pfizer revealed that Covid-19 products didn’t sell as much as planned.
This put a damper on Wall Street’ optimism after a good start to the year. So far, investors have been behaving as if earnings season was about to be exceptional and the Fed was gonna turn dovish any minute, but the latest results reminded them that businesses are operating in a difficult environment and things are perhaps not so rosy.

Some 140 S&P 500 companies had reported their fourth-quarter results by Monday, and earnings are expected to be 3% lower than the same quarter last year, according to Refinitiv data.
Defensive stocks took their revenge yesterday, after having gone through a complicated period. By the game of communicating vessels, the more audacious bets have been abandoned. Given the exceptional rise recorded during the month of January by equities, it is difficult to blame investors for securing some gains before the main source of volatility of the week, the decision of the U.S. central bank on its rates tomorrow. The U.S. Nasdaq returned more than 2%, which took the balance of January's rise below 10%.
Macroeconomics will be the focus today and tomorrow, despite the continuation of corporate earnings releases. Overnight, the International Monetary Fund slightly raised its growth forecast for the global economy this year. The worst-case scenario has not materialized. The UK seems to be the only G7 country to slip into recession. Even Russia is expected to escape it. But these are only forecasts. Like central bankers, investment bankers, financial commentators and any stock market trader, the major international organizations are speculating. The chief economist of the IMF had this cryptic statement, "we have to be sort of prepared to expect the unexpected". The good thing about this kind of thinking, besides being able to win the annual open door contest, is that it allows you to be right all the time. Until the next update.
As we await the central banks, with the Fed tomorrow and the ECB, Bank of England duo on Thursday, there will be a slew of macroeconomic statistics today. The day did not start too badly from this point of view with improving figures in Japan and China. In particular, official Chinese PMI indicators returned to the expansion zone, by the smallest of margins for manufacturing, and more vigorously in services. The end of the main Covid restrictions has boosted the outlook for economic activity. This is part of what is driving the current Western optimism, along with the moderation in inflation, and has been cited by the IMF as a reason for raising its forecast.
So far this morning, futures are slightly up for the Nasdaq, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones.
 
Economic highlights of the day:
There will be a lot of macroeconomic indicators today, especially in Europe with preliminary inflation figures in France and Germany or the latest Eurozone GDP. In the United States, we have housing prices (9:00 am) and the Chicago PMI (9:45 am) and the Conference Board's January consumer confidence index (10:00 am). All the agenda is here. Overnight, Japan reported stronger-than-expected industrial production and retail sales for the past month, while China released its official PMI indicators, with manufacturing activity growing slightly, in line with expectations, and a more robust-than-expected services PMI well anchored in the expansion zone.
