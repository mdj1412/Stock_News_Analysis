SAO PAULO, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Brazil's Vale SA
, one of the world's largest mining companies, on
Tuesday reported a fourth-quarter 1% fall in iron ore production
from a year earlier, while the sales volume of nickel soaredThe company said it produced 80.85 million tonnes of iron
ore during the last three months of 2022, sending its annual
output to 307.8 million tonnes, slightly below its 310 million
tonne forecast.Vale blamed seasonally higher rainfall levels in its
mines in Brazil for missing its forecast, as well as slower
licensing processes in its Northern System.Sales volumes of iron ore, a key material for making
steel, fell 0.7% in the quarter, but still came in 24.2% above
the previous three months, the company said.Vale's production of nickel fell 1.3% to 47,400 tonnes in
the quarter, after scheduled maintenance stoppages at plants in
Canada. Its sales volumes, however, soared 30.2% to 58,200
tonnes, as the company shifted pent-up stocks to fulfill supply
contracts.Last month, Vale predicted an 2023 nickel output below last
year's levels while iron ore production should remain flat.The metal is also a key material for the booming electric
vehicle industry, where it is used in the cathode component of
batteries. Vale has struck contracts to supply nickel to major
auto makers including Tesla and General Motors.Looking to capitalize on soaring demand for nickel and
copper from the EV market, Vale has been seeking a partner to
buy a minority stake in its base metals unit.Earlier this month, it said it had received non-binding
offers for the stake, but did not disclose any names.
