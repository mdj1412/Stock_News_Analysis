Jan 31 (Reuters) - Top U.S. proxy advisers Glass Lewis
and Institutional Shareholder Services on Tuesday defended their
corporate voting recommendations on environmental and social
matters, with both saying they remain focused on long-term
shareholder value.The two companies were questioned by Republican
attorneys general from 21 states earlier this month about
whether their guidance on issues like climate change or
boardroom diversity violate their duties to clients.In a response letter dated Jan. 31, Glass Lewis Executive
Chairman Kevin Cameron pushed back on the suggestion and said
that under the firm's benchmark policy it routinely recommends
against shareholder proposals "that -- however worthwhile as a
social goal -- have not demonstrated a nexus to shareholder
value."In addition, Cameron wrote that issues like how companies
manage the risks and opportunities presented by climate change
"is widely recognized as a material risk-return factor today."
Nearly all companies in the S&P 500 now publish sustainability
reports using various third-party standards, he noted.In a separate letter provided by a spokesman, ISS Chief
Executive Gary Retelny wrote that while environmental, social
and governance (ESG) considerations have grown more important to
investors, "fulfilling our fiduciary and contractual
responsibilities to our clients remains the foundation of our
business."The two leading proxy advisers provide suggestions on
how clients like pension plans should vote on everything from
electing board members to signing off on executive pay at
corporate annual meetings.In the past, both have faced criticism from corporate
executives over advice for shareholders to vote against board
recommendations. Last week Tesla Inc Chief Executive
Elon Musk said in a tweet that the two firms have "far too much
power."But academic reviews have found mixed evidence about the
firms' impact as big shareholders like BlackRock Inc and
Vanguard Group, under pressure from socially minded investors,
put more resources into determining their ESG-related votes.
