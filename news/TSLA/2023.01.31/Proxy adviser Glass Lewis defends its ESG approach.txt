Jan 31 (Reuters) - U.S. proxy adviser Glass Lewis on
Tuesday defended its corporate voting recommendations on
environmental and social matters, saying it considers them only
"through the lens of long-term shareholder value."The company and its larger rival Institutional Shareholder
Services (ISS) were questioned by Republican attorneys general
from 21 states earlier this month about whether their guidance
on issues like climate change or boardroom diversity violate
their duties to clients.In a response letter dated Jan. 31, Glass Lewis Executive
Chairman Kevin Cameron pushed back on the suggestion and said
that under the firm's benchmark policy it routinely recommends
against shareholder proposals "that -- however worthwhile as a
social goal -- have not demonstrated a nexus to shareholder
value."In addition, Cameron wrote that issues like how companies
manage the risks and opportunities presented by climate change
"is widely recognized as a material risk-return factor today."
Nearly all companies in the S&P 500 now publish sustainability
reports using various third-party standards, he noted.ISS did not immediately comment.The two leading proxy advisers give suggestions on how
institutional clients like pension plans should vote on
everything from electing board members to signing off on
executive pay at corporate annual meetings.In the past both have faced criticism from corporate
executives over advice for shareholders to vote against board
recommendations. Last week Tesla Inc Chief Executive
Elon Musk said in a tweet that the two firms have "far too much
power."But academic reviews have found mixed evidence about the
firms' impact as big shareholders like BlackRock Inc and
Vanguard Group, under pressure from socially minded investors,
put more resources into determining their votes on
environmental, social and governance issues.
