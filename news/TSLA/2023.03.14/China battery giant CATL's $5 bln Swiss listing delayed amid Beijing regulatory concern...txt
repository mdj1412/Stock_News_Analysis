HONG KONG, March 14 (Reuters) - Chinese battery giant
CATL's plan to raise at least $5 billion in Swiss global
depository receipts (GDR) has been delayed as Beijing regulators
raise concerns over the large scale of the offering, three
people with direct knowledge of the matter said.The world's largest battery maker, formally known as
Contemporary Amperex Technology Co (CATL), had
expected to receive a green light for the listing in Zurich from
the Chinese securities regulator by the end of January, said one
of the sources. But the process is taking longer than expected,
all three sources told Reuters.The delay has come to light a week after Chinese President
Xi Jinping told CATL that he had mixed feelings about its status
as the biggest player in a soaring business tracking the rise of
electric vehicles around the world. Xi's comments came in a rare
public intervention about one of China's most globally
competitive sectors.In a response to a presentation by CATL's chairman Robin
Zeng on the sidelines of China's annual parliament meeting last
week, Xi was quoted by official media as saying that he was
"both happy and worried" - glad about CATL's industry-leading
position, but concerned about the risks as the company expands
rapidly overseas and moves to undercut domestic rivals.CATL, worth about $139 billion by market value and now
expanding in Germany and the United States, already controls 37%
of the global battery market, according to its 2022 annual
report. It supplies auto giants like Tesla Inc,
Volkswagen and BMW.The company has told the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC), whose approval for the listing is required,
that it plans to use the proceeds to fund its European expansion
plans, especially the development of a plant in Hungary, one
source said, and potentially also finance its expansion in the
United States.In early February, sources said CATL aimed to go ahead
with the listing as early as May. There is no new timetable for
the deal to proceed, according to the sources, who said they
could not be named as they were discussing private information.The CSRC did not immediately comment when contacted by
Reuters.CATL did not respond to a request for comment.PRIVATE PLACEMENTThe sources said the Chinese regulator has concerns over the
vast scale of CATL's GDR offering.The CSRC is also examining CATL's planned use of proceeds,
sources said, adding the regulator has questioned the battery
maker's need to raise so much money after it raised 45 billion
yuan ($6.56 billion) in a jumbo domestic share placement in
June.The company said at the time proceeds raised in the
placement will be used to fund the production and upgrades of
lithium-ion batteries in four Chinese cities, and enhance
research and development.The private placement was the biggest equity capital market
transaction in China last year and the second largest follow-on
deal globally in 2022, according to Dealogic data.At $5 billion, the GDR deal would easily be the largest such
listing by a Chinese company in Switzerland, according to
Refinitiv data.Chinese companies began listing in Switzerland last year
after the launch of cross-listing platform to allow companies to
raise capital by issuing and listing GDRs on the Swiss exchange
SIX. Swiss companies can issue Chinese Depository Receipts on
the Chinese exchanges.According to Refinitiv data, 11 Chinese companies have
raised $3.66 billion from Swiss listings since the launch last
year.GDRs are one fundraising option used by companies to offer
investors outside the firms' home bases a chance to buy and
trade the stock on shareholders' local exchanges.Offshore investors are attracted to Chinese issuers' GDRs as
they can generally buy the shares with a 10% discount and freely
convert them into corresponding Chinese shares after 120 days of
trading on European boards. With much better liquidity on the
domestic market, investors can exit more easily.But when investors transfer the capital from onshore to
offshore, it consumes some of China's foreign exchange reserves,
while issuers usually keep the proceeds raised for overseas use.
Such practices have also made Chinese regulators less keen to
wave through mega-GDR offerings, two of the sources with
knowledge of the matter said.
