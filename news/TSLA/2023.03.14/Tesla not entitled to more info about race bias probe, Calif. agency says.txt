March 14 (Reuters) - A California civil rights agency
suing Tesla Inc over alleged widespread race bias at
its flagship assembly plant on Tuesday asked a judge to narrow
the scope of his tentative ruling requiring the agency to
provide more details about the probe it conducted prior to
filing the lawsuit.Lawyers from the state's Civil Rights Department urged Judge
Evelio Grillo during a court hearing in Oakland to limit a
tentative ruling he issued on Monday requesting more
information.California state judges typically issue tentative rulings
ahead of hearings, but can make changes to those rulings when
issuing final decisions. Grillo said he would issue a final
ruling in the next few days.California law requires the civil rights department to
investigate discrimination complaints by workers before suing
employers. If the agency did not adequately probe certain claims
against Tesla before suing, the electric carmaker could seek to
have them removed from the case.The agency claims that Tesla's Fremont, California, plant is
a racially segregated workplace where Black employees have been
harassed and discriminated against in job assignments,
discipline and pay. Tesla has denied the allegations and said
the lawsuit was politically motivated.Sirithon Thanasombat, a lawyer for the department, told
Grillo on Tuesday that courts only have the power to determine
whether an investigation took place and not to inquire into the
details or sufficiency of an investigation.Tesla’s lawyer, Thomas Hill, countered that some level of
detail is required to make that determination.“Our defense with regard to at least some of the claims in
this case is that no investigation was conducted at all,” Hill
said.Grillo said he was concerned that not requiring the
department to provide any details could violate Tesla’s
constitutional right to due process, since the company is
entitled to argue that the agency failed to investigate the
claims before suing.But the judge also said that there should be some limit to
the information the department must provide.“You don’t get to inquire into the most minute details,”
Grillo said. “But in between that and ‘trust us,’ there’s a big
gap.”Several other lawsuits are pending in California courts that
accuse Tesla of tolerating discrimination and sexual harassment
at its factories. Tesla has denied wrongdoing.A federal judge in Oakland in April 2022 cut a jury award to
a Black worker who alleged racial harassment from $137 million
to $15 million. The worker rejected the reduced award and opted
for a new trial on damages, which is scheduled to begin on March
27.
