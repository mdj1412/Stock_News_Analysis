Feb 16 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Wednesday
it laid off 4% of the employees in the Autopilot labeling team
in Buffalo as part of a performance review cycle conducted every
six months.The automaker responded to a union complaint filed with a
government agency alleging that the company laid off dozens of
employees from its Autopilot department at its Buffalo plant in
New York, a day after workers launched a campaign to form a
union.The company said the impacted employees were identified on
Feb. 3, which was before the union campaign was announced. "We
became aware of organizing activities approximately 10 days
later," the company said, adding that the layoffs predated any
union campaign.Earlier this week, Tesla workers in New York said they will
unionize with Workers United Upstate New York, which would help
give them a voice at their workplace.The Workers United Upstate New York union in a filing with
the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) earlier on
Wednesday accused the world's most valuable automaker of hitting
back by terminating some of the employees "in retaliation for
union activity".The company fired more than 30 employees, the union said in
the statement, adding that the workers also received an email
with an updated policy, which prohibits them from recording
workplace meetings without all participants' permission."This policy violates federal labor law and also flouts New
York's one-party consent law to record conversations."Over the last six months, the company said the department's
employee base has grown 54% to 675 employees as of the beginning
of this week, from 437 earlier.The employees had asked the electric carmaker to respect
their right to organize a union and called on the company to
sign the Fair Election Principles, which would prevent Tesla
from threatening or retaliating against the workers.Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has in the past been vocal
about his opposition to unions and said in a 2018 tweet that
employees would lose their stock options if they formed a union,
prompting the NLRB to ask him to delete the tweet.
