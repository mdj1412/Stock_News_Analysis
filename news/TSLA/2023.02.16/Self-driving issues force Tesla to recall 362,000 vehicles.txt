The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the Tesla software allows a vehicle to "exceed speed limits or travel through intersections in an unlawful or unpredictable manner increasing the risk of a crash."Tesla will release an over-the-air software update free of charge, and the electric vehicle maker said it is not aware of any injuries or deaths that may be related to the recall issue.  This is a fresh setback for Tesla's driver assistance system, which faces growing regulatory and public scrutiny. Chief Executive Elon Musk has repeatedly missed his own targets to achieve self-driving capability, which he has touted as a potential cash cow. While Tesla's Autopilot feature assists with steering, accelerating and braking, the company says its full self-driving is a more advanced system that is "designed to provide more active guidance and assisted driving" though still requiring the driver's attention.U.S. senators Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal, both Democrats, said the recall was "long overdue," adding: "Tesla must finally stop overstating the real capabilities of its vehicles."The electric carmaker could not be reached for comment, but Musk tweeted on Thursday that the word "recall" for an over-the-air software update is "anachronistic and just flat wrong!"Tesla shares, which have been on a tear so far in 2023, closed lower on the day.
