SEOUL, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co
said on Thursday it expects to have solid backorder demand in
major car markets and forecast robust growth in electric vehicle
sales, including in the United States where regulatory concerns
have clouded its outlook.The South Korean maker of the Ioniq 5 model is targeting an
ambitious 54% jump in EV sales in 2023 to 330,000 globally and
said it wants its U.S. electric car sales to climb 150% to
73,000 to account for 9% of its U.S. vehicle sales.The plans were outlined at its fourth-quarter earnings
briefing where the automaker reported a tripling of net profit,
albeit one that fell short of expectations. It also said it was
cancelling treasury shares equivalent to 1% of its outstanding
stock."Strong earnings in the fourth quarter continued thanks to
increased sales volume and solid sales of high-margin vehicles
as well as favourable exchange rates," said Seo Gang Hyun, an
executive vice president.Like many other automakers, Hyundai benefited from the tight
supply of new vehicles last year which kept retail prices high.Seo also noted its results benefited from an improved global
plant utilisation rate excluding China which rose 7.6 percentage
points to 96.8% from the previous quarter.Net profit for October-December tripled to 1.7 trillion won
($1.4 billion) on a 24% climb in revenue. The profit growth
looked particularly strong as Hyundai booked one-off costs in
the same period a year earlier.That, however, fell short of a Refinitiv SmartEstimate
of 2.5 trillion won drawn from 18 analysts, partly due to a
wider non-recurring loss that the automaker did not elaborate
on.Both Hyundai and affiliate Kia Corp have been
dogged by concerns that they will be hurt by President Joe
Biden's Inflation Reduction Act that excludes Korean automakers
from federal tax credits because they don't yet make EVs in
North America.However, Jose Fernandez, the under secretary of state
for economic growth, energy and the environment, told an event
at a Washington-based think tank this week that Washington is
looking "for ways to try and ameliorate some of what (Koreans)
believe are unfair consequences."Those remarks, reported by South Korean media on
Wednesday and Thursday, as well as Hyundai's upbeat targets,
helped shares in Hyundai end the day 5.6% higher while those in
Kia surged 6.6%.Hyundai is targeting revenue growth of 10.5%-11.5% this
year. It expects a 9.6% jump in North American vehicle sales and
a 20.5% surge in China vehicle sales.It also flagged potential improvement in its operating
profit margin, predicting a margin between 6.5% and 7.5%
compared with 6.9% last year.Hyundai's plans come on the heels of a positive outlook
provided hours earlier by Tesla Inc which said its
aggressive price cuts have ignited a wave of demand for its
vehicles.($1 = 1,230.8600 won)
