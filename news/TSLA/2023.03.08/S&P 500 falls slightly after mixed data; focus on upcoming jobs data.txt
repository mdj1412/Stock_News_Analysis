cars*Occidental rises as Buffett's Berkshire boosts stake to
22.2%*Private payrolls stronger than expected in February*Indexes: Dow off 0.48%, S&P off 0.17%, Nasdaq up 0.08%March 8 (Reuters) -The S&P 500 index edged lower on Wednesday as
investors grappled with mixed messages from Federal Reserve
Chair Jerome Powell and U.S. economic data ahead of February's
labor and inflation reports.Stocks fell sharply on Tuesday after Powell told U.S.
lawmakers the Fed would likely need to raise interest rates more
than expected. But in a second day of testimony to Congress on
Wednesday, the policymaker did not commit to a widely expected
50 basis point rate hike in March.Powell said the Fed had not yet made a call on the size of
the rate increase, suggesting that would depend on economic
data.Data released on Wednesday showed U.S. private payrolls
increased more than expected in February, pointing to a strong
labor market ahead of Friday's closely watched nonfarm payrolls
report.The U.S. jobs report showed openings decreased to 10.82
million in January, hotter than economists' expectations for
10.5 million, and data for the prior month was revised higher.
Layoffs rose in January and job cuts were higher than initially
thought in 2022 while fewer people voluntarily quit their jobs."We received very little definitive guidance today from the
numbers and Powell was kind of neutral, reinforcing that he's
data dependent," said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling
Capital Management in Austin, Texas.So with very clear economic guidance to change investors'
minds ahead of Friday's jobs report, "nobody wants to take
particularly large bets before the payroll numbers and the
inflation numbers," Phipps said.Traders kept increasing bets for a U.S. central bank rate
hike of 50 basis points later this month, with fed funds futures
most recently showing a roughly 80% chance for such a hike, up
from about 70% on Tuesday and 31% on Monday before Powell's
first testimony, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 158.3 points,
or 0.48%, to 32,698.16; the S&P 500 lost 6.8 points, or
0.17%, at 3,979.57; and the Nasdaq Composite added 9.43
points, or 0.08%, at 11,539.76.Among the S&P's 11 major sectors, six were in the red with
energy falling most, down 1.3%. Leading gains was real
estate, up 0.96%.Tesla Inc slid 3.3% after the U.S. auto safety
regulator said it was opening a preliminary investigation into
120,000 Model Y 2023 vehicles following reports about steering
wheels falling off while driving.Occidental Petroleum Corp gained 1.8% after Warren
Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc increased its stake in
the oil company to about 22.2%.Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a
1.46-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.48-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&P 500 posted two new 52-week highs and 11 new lows;
the Nasdaq Composite recorded 40 new highs and 155 new lows.(Reporting by Sin√©ad Carew in New York, Shristi  Achar A,
