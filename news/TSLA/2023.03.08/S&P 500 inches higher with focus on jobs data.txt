after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell did not commit to a 50
basis point rate hike in March, but strong labor market readings
supported views that the U.S. central bank will stick to its
hawkish policy for longer.Fed officials have not yet made a call on the size of the
rate increase they are almost certain to deliver at their
upcoming policy meeting, Powell told a House panel as part of
testimony on the economy and monetary policy.U.S. stock indexes tumbled more than 1% on Tuesday and the
S&P 500 logged its biggest percentage decline in two weeks,
after Powell told U.S. lawmakers the Fed would likely need to
raise rates more than expected in response to strong data.Data on Wednesday showed U.S. private payrolls increased
more than expected in February, pointing to continued labor
market strength ahead of the all-important nonfarm payrolls
report on Friday.Another set showed U.S. job openings decreased to a
greater-than-expected 10.82 million in January and data for the
prior month was revised higher."We are still looking at a situation where the labor market
is still very tight," said Matt Stucky, senior portfolio manager
at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. "The Fed is pretty
clear that they want to see some slack in the labor markets."Markets have started to price in a higher peak rate in the
face of data showing that the economy is faring better than
expected despite aggressive interest rate hikes over the last
year.Traders see a nearly 70% chance that the U.S. central bank
will raise rates by 50 basis points later this month, up from
23% before Powell's comments on Tuesday.Growth stocks such as Apple Inc and Nvidia Corp

Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc increased its stake in
