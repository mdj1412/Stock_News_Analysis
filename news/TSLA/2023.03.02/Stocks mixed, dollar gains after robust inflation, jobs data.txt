(Updates to early afternoon U.S. trading)*Wall Street stocks mixed after Wednesday's gains*Europe ticks up despite sticky inflation numbers*Treasury yields hit 16-week high, dollar gains*U.S. jobless claims fall againMarch 2 (Reuters) -Global stock markets were mixed on Thursday, as investors
weighed indicators of economic strength with rising bond market
costs and expectations of more global interest rate hikes.After initially sagging, European shares rose
0.5%as euro zone inflation numbers justified what is widely
expected to be another 50 basis point hike in the European
Central Bank's already decade-high rates this month.Consumer price inflation in the 20 countries sharing the
euro currency eased to 8.5% in February from 8.6% in January on
lower energy prices, a barely noticeable move and above the 8.2%
economists polled by Reuters had expected.It was not enough to lift the euro or stall the dollar's
rise though, with Wall Street stocks lacking clear
direction as U.S. jobless claims numbers fell again and a
measure of the price of labor increased at a 3.2% annualized
rate last quarter.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.37%,
lifted by Salesforce Inc, whose shares jumped about 11%
after the cloud-based software provider gave an upbeat full-yearprofit forecastand doubled its share repurchase program.The S&P 500 lost 0.1% and Nasdaq Composite
dropped 0.37%, as Tesla Inc fell around 6%. The company
said it would cut vehicle assembly costs by half in future
generations of cars, but Chief Executive Elon Musk did not
unveil a much-awaited small, affordable electric vehicle.MSCI's broadest index of world shares fell
0.2% to around seven-week lows.Stock and bond markets in recent weeks have been driven by
different factors, said Kevin Gardiner, global investment
strategist at Rothschild & Co. The chief concern in stocks is
the expectation of pressured corporate profits, while bonds are
sensitive to inflation and rate expectations."The economic impact of tightening remains a puzzle.
Profitability might not be that fragile, at least, not yet," he
said.Overnight, both benchmark government bonds and shares had
taken a blow, as inflation indicators from Germany and the
United States reinforced expectations interest rates would go
higher and stay there for longerGermany's 2-year government bond yield rose to
its highest since October 2008.In the United States, manufacturing activity contracted for
a fourth-straight month in February, but a gauge of prices for
raw materials increased last month, stoking concerns that
inflation would remain stubborn."Economic data has surprised to the upside," said Steven Oh,
global head of credit and fixed income at PineBridge
Investments. Any unexpected result in the data would drive
policymakers to be more aggressive, and that's reset market
expectations, he said.PRESSURE POINTSBenchmark 10-year Treasury yields hit a fresh
four-month high of 4.085%, while two-year yields also
advanced to 4.916%, around a fresh 16-year high.Investors still mostly foresee the Fed raising rates by 25
basis points at its next meeting later this month, but
expectations of a larger 50 basis points hike have increased.
The probability that the Fed's policy rate, currently set in the
4.5% to 4.75% range, could peak above 5.5%, stood at 53%,
compared with 41.5% on Feb. 28, according to the CME Fedwatch
tool."We expect interest rates to stay higher for longer, and we
expect stock market volatility ahead," strategists at the
Wells Fargo Investment Institute wrote on Thursday, adding that
stronger-than-expected economic data this winter pushed their
recession outlook into the second half of 2023.DOLLAR REBOUND CONTINUESIn currency markets, the U.S. dollar index, measuring
its value against a basket of major peers, gained 0.6% at
$105.111. The index is now up about 1.5% for the year, but still
down from a September high around $114.The euro lost 0.75% and the pound dropped
0.8%, with hotter-than-expected inflation numbers adding
pressure on the ECB to raise rates.In the crypto world, shares in Silvergate Capital
plunged 49% after the cryptocurrency-focused bank said it was
delaying its annual report and was evaluating its ability to
operate as a going concern. Bitcoin was last down about
1% at $23,303.Oil was flatas signs of a strong economic rebound in top crude importer
China conflicted with fears over the impact of potential
European interest rate hikes. U.S. crude was flat at
$77.70 per barrel and Brent was at $84.21, down 0.12% on
the day.Spot gold was slightly lower at $1,833 per ounce.(Reporting by Lawrence Delevingne in Boston and Nell Mackenzie
