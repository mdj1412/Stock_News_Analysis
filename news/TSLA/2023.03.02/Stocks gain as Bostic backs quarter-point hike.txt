2020*Weekly jobless claims fall more than expected*Dow up 1.05%, S&P 500 up 0.76%, Nasdaq up 0.73%NEW YORK, March 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on
Thursday, as Treasury yields pulled back from earlier highs
following comments from Atlanta Federal Reserve President
Raphael Bostic about his favored path of interest rate hikes for
the central bank.In an argument for quarter-point hikes, Bostic said he
favored "slow and steady" as the appropriate course of action
for the Fed, as the impact of higher interest rates may only
start to be felt in the spring.The yield on 10-year Treasury notes had earlier
touched a fresh four-month high of 4.091% after data showed the
number of Americans filing new unemployment claims fell again
last week, indicating continued strength in the labor market,
while a separate report showed U.S. labor costs grew faster than
initially thought in the fourth quarter. The 10-year yield
was last up 6.7 basis points to 4.064%.The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically
moves in step with interest rate expectations, was down 0.4
basis points at 4.885% after earlier touching a fresh 15-year
high at 4.944%."Bostic has been a little bit more hawkish so the fact that
he basically said 25 was comforting because he has been on the
hawkish end of hawkish people," said Rhys Williams, chief
strategist at Spouting Rock Asset Management in Bryn Mawr,
Pennsylvania."The Fed is not crazy, they understand monetary policy works
with a lag, so you are just starting to see now the impact of
the first rate hikes, let alone the other 400 basis points they
did."The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 341.73 points,
or 1.05%, to 33,003.57, the S&P 500 gained 29.96 points,
or 0.76%, to 3,981.35 and the Nasdaq Composite added
83.50 points, or 0.73%, to 11,462.98.Fed funds futures tied to the Fed's policy rate see about an
even chance that the rate will get to a range of 5.5%-5.75% by
September, from the current range of 4.5%-4.75%.At the closing bell, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said a
string of "hot" data may force the U.S. central bank to raise
rates higher than the 5.1%-5.4% range projected by the majority
of Federal Reserve policymakers as recently as December.Monthly payrolls and consumer prices data in the coming days
will offer investors more clues on how aggressive the central
bank may be heading into the Fed's March 21-22 meeting, where it
is currently expected to raise rates by 25 basis points.The S&P 500 was trading just above its 200-day moving
average of about 3,940, seen as a key support level by traders,
after briefly falling below it for the first time since Jan. 25
earlier in the session.Salesforce Inc soared 11.50% to notch its biggest
one-day percentage gain since August 2020, after the cloud-based
software firm forecast first-quarter revenue above analysts'
estimates and doubled its share buyback to $20 billion.Tesla Inc fell 5.85% after Chief Executive Elon
Musk and team's four-hour presentation failed to impress
investors with few details on its plan to unveil an affordable
electric vehicle.Macy's Inc jumped 11.11% after the department store
operator forecast full-year profit above Wall Street estimates,Silvergate Capital plunged 57.72% after the
crypto-focused lender delayed its annual report and said it was
evaluating its ability to operate as a going concern.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.15 billion shares, compared
with the 11.46 billion average for the full session over the
last 20 trading days.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a
1.19-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.10-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and 13 new lows; the
Nasdaq Composite recorded 80 new highs and 153 new lows.(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Aurora Ellis)
