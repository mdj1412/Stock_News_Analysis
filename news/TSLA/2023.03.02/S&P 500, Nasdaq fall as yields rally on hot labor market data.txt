tech-heavy Nasdaq fell on Thursday as the 10-year Treasury yield
held above 4% following hotter-than-expected labor market data,
while strong results from software company Salesforce boosted
the blue-chip Dow.The yield on 10-year Treasury notes touched a
fresh four-month high of 4.07% after data showed the number of
Americans filing new unemployment claims fell again last week,
pointing to sustained strength in the labor market.Another report showed U.S. labor costs grew faster than
initially thought in the fourth quarter.The two-year yield, which best reflects
short-term rate expectations, hit a fresh 15-year high at 4.91%."It doesn't look like the jobs market is responding to
higher rates. The unit labor cost is double the expectations
because wages are up and productivity is down, so nothing is
really working in favor of markets," said Jack Ablin, chief
investment officer at Cresset Capital.After a lackluster February, Wall Street indexes kicked off
March on a volatile note as fresh evidence of persistent price
pressures and comments from Federal Reserve policymakers fueled
worries about the U.S. central bank staying hawkish for longer.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell on Wednesday after data showed
U.S. manufacturing contracted for a fourth straight month in
February, although raw material prices increased last month.Traders of futures tied to the Fed's policy rate see about
an even chance that the rate will get to a range of 5.5%-5.75%
by September, from the current range of 4.5%-4.75%.Monthly payrolls and consumer prices data in the coming days
will offer investors more clues on the path of rates heading
into the Fed's March 21-22 meeting, where it is currently
expected to raise rates by 25 basis points.At 11:41 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
was up 96.67 points, or 0.30%, at 32,758.51, the S&P 500
was down 9.32 points, or 0.24%, at 3,942.07, and the Nasdaq
Composite was down 66.20 points, or 0.58%, at 11,313.29.The S&P 500 was trading just above its 200-day moving
average, seen as a key support level by traders."This is a level where people would traditionally be looking
to buy. And we have a vacuum of any further negative catalyst
until later in March, so this is an area of no downside in the
near term," said David Russell, vice president of market
intelligence at TradeStation.Salesforce Inc soared 11.6%, set for its best day
since August 2020, after the cloud-based software firm forecast
first-quarter revenue above analysts' estimates and doubled its
