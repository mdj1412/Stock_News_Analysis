Feb 8 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's Model Y and Model
3 electric vehicles were the top-sellers in California last
year, outselling Toyota Motor Corp's RAV4 and Camry
models, according to an industry body report.It is the first time a Tesla model topped the annual sales
list in California, a major vehicle market where one in five
cars is electric.Austin, Texas-based Tesla sold 87,257 Model Y electric sport
utility vehicles and 78,934 Model 3 electric sedans last year,
while Toyota sold 59,794 units of its RAV4 SUV and 55,967 of its
Camry sedans, the California New Car Dealers Association said in
its report.In 2021, the Camry was the top-seller in California,
followed by the Model Y, Honda's Civic and RAV4, and
the Model 3.Toyota retained its top spot in the state for vehicle
brands, with a market share of 17.3% in 2022, followed by Tesla
at 11.2%.The report noted that the appetite for Tesla's vehicles is
much larger in California than the nationwide average, which
accounts for only 3.5 percent of the brand market share.Last year, zero-emission vehicles accounted for 19% of all
cars sold in California, which brought in 40% of all sales of
electric vehicles, including hybrid vehicles, in the United
States.
