Feb 8 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive
Elon Musk will reveal the third part of the electric vehicle
(EV) maker's "Master Plan" when the company holds its first
investor day on March 1.In 2006 and 2016, the billionaire laid out his vision for
the electric carmaker, but much of the plans have yet to be
achieved."Master Plan 3, the path to a fully sustainable energy
future for Earth will be presented on March 1," Musk tweeted on
Wednesday.At Tesla's annual shareholder meeting in August, Musk said
the third part of his Master Plan was "going to fundamentally be
about scaling" both car production and the supply chain that
supports it such as battery materials and components.At the upcoming investor day to be held at its gigafactory
in Texas, Tesla said it will share details about its
next-generation vehicle platforms, which Musk has said would
produce a vehicle about half the cost of Tesla's current vehicle
underpinings.Tesla also said it will discuss long-term expansion plans,
capital allocation and other subjects.Last year, Tesla shares posted their worst annual
performance as Musk sold Tesla shares to fund his purchase of
Twitter and other shareholders lost confidence in his focus on
the carmaker, whose sales growth was not as much as some
investors had hoped.In 2006, Musk unveiled "a secret mast plan," which includes an affordable electric car, but Tesla's
cheapest model is $43,490 in the United States.In 2016, Musk unveiled his "Master Plan, Part Deux," a
four-point plan which includes expanding its electric vehicle
lineup to all major segments and achieving "true self-driving."
Its Semi heavy duty electric trucks has started "pilot
production" last year, while its Cybertruck pickup trucks have
been pushed back to 2023.As part of that 2016 plan, Musk said Tesla drivers would
be able to sleep, read or do anything else enroute to their
destination and make money by renting out their autonomous
vehicles when they are not in use. But Musk said in October last
year its cars are not ready to have no one behind the wheel,
after missing his targets to achieve self-driving capability.
