lower on Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told
Congress the central bank will likely need to raise interest
rates more than previously expected as it seeks to rein in
stubbornly high inflation.Of Wall Street's three major indexes, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average lost most ground with a 1.7% decline,
while the S&P 500 fell 1.5% and the Nasdaq Composite
lost almost 1.3%.Powell sent stock investors fleeing when he told U.S.
lawmakers earlier in the day that the Fed is prepared to hike
rates in larger steps if future economic data suggests tougher
measures are needed to control rising prices.The remarks followed recent data showing an unexpected
inflation increase in January and an unusually large jobs gain
for the month.Traders dramatically raised their bets for a 50-basis-point
rate hike in March after Powell's comments, with money market
futures last pricing in a more than 70% chance of such a move,
up from around 31% on Monday, according to CME Group's FedWatch
tool.While many investors had worried that the Fed would
consider higher rates for longer than previously expected,
"hearing it directly from Powell is a little different to
inferring it from the data," said Chris Zaccarelli, chief
investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance."From a risk-rewards standpoint investors have to
recalculate their desire to be invested with this new paradigm,"
said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of 50 Park Investments, based
in Orlando, Florida. "It's the realization the Fed is going to
err on the side of being more hawkish."The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 574.98 points,
or 1.72%, to 32,856.46; the S&P 500 lost 62.05 points, or
1.53%, at 3,986.37; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped
145.40 points, or 1.25%, to 11,530.33.All 11 major S&P sectors closed lower, led by
economically sensitive financials which finished down
2.5%. Declining least was the consumer staples index,
down 0.97%.Powell, who will testify again on Wednesday before the House
of Representatives Financial Services Committee, also added that
the Fed would not consider changing its 2% inflation target and
the job market does not suggest an economic downturn is close.Data influencing the Fed's rate hiking path will include
Friday's closely watched nonfarm payroll additions for February.
Economists polled by Reuters are expecting an increase of
200,000 jobs compared with the much stronger-than-expected
517,000 jobs reported in January.While traders were flipping bets in favor of a 50 basis
point rate hike this month, Scott Ladner, chief investment
officer at Horizon Investments, said the size of the hike would
depend on the upcoming payrolls data and inflation numbers.But John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth
Management, argued that with employment and consumption showing
strength so far, investors should have been expecting Powell's
more hawkish tone.Meanwhile, the yield on two-year Treasury notes,
which best reflects short-term rate expectations, hit 5% for the
first time since July 2007.Rising bond yields tend to weigh on equity valuations,
particularly those of growth and technology stocks, as higher
rates reduce the value of future cash flows.Big individual stock moves included a 14.5% tumble for
Rivian Automotive after the electric automaker unveiled
plans to sell bonds worth $1.3 billion.Dick's Sporting Goods rallied 11% after the retailer
forecast annual earnings above Wall Street estimates and more
than doubled its quarterly dividend.Shares of Tesla Inc closed down 3%, failing to get
a lift after CEO Elon Musk told an investor conference he saw a
clear path to producing a smaller vehicle at half the production
cost of the Model 3.Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a
4.00-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.21-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&P 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and nine new
lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 146 new
lows.On U.S. exchanges 11.17 billion shares changed hands, up
from the 10.98 billion average for the last 20 sessions.(Reporting by Sin√©ad Carew in New York, Sruthi Shankar and
