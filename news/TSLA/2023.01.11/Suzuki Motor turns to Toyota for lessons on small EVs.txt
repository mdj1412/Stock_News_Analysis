*Suzuki expects to build EV from scratch*Says will launch more SUVs*Seeks to reclaim 50% market share in India*Sees long-term growth for small car segment in IndiaGREATER NOIDA, India, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Japan's Suzuki
Motor Corp (SMC) plans to learn from partner Toyota
Motor Corp how to use EV technology to build small
electric cars, its president Toshihiro Suzuki told reporters
during India's biennial car show on Wednesday.Suzuki said it is learning EV and other technologies from
Toyota with a goal to develop cars that are more in line with
its own products."So how to introduce this EV technology on small cars is
something we need to work upon and share with Toyota," he said
on the sidelines of the car show.After a slow start to EVs, Toyota – which has a 4.89% stake
in Suzuki – is considering a reboot of its electric car strategy
given the rise in popularity of Tesla's cars.The Japanese car giant's planning previously assumed demand
for EVs would not take off for several decades, Reuters reported
last year.When asked if SMC would consider launching EVs built on
gasoline engine platforms, Suzuki said the company needed to
develop an EV from scratch.India's EV market has gained momentum. Tata Motors
, which dominates electric car sales in the country, as
well as foreign players SAIC Motor's MG Motor,
Mercedes Benz and Stellantis have lined up
launches.With planned investments of up to $1.3 billion to make EVs
and batteries locally, Suzuki is pushing deeper into India,
which is set to become an EV hub for the Japanese carmaker.Suzuki is the majority-owner of Maruti, which has faced
growing competition from rivals as buyers shift to bigger cars
such as SUVs and regulators demand safer and greener cars,
increasing costs. This has pushed its market share to under 43%
from over 50% in 2019."One of the reasons we could not sustain 50% market share
... there was a delay in launching SUVs at our end," Suzuki
Motor Corp president Toshihiro Suzuki said, adding the company
was trying to recover its market share by launching more SUVs."We see potential of long term growth in the small car
segment. We have to make effort for deeper penetration and
further spread the sale of compact and small cars in India," he
said, adding Suzuki would work with Maruti to regain market
share.Maruti dominates car sales in India with its small, low-cost
vehicles, making the South Asian nation one of the most
important markets for the Japanese company.India contributes 50% to 60% in revenues to SMC and this
ratio is likely to increase in the future, Suzuki said at the
event held on the outskirts of the capital city of New Delhi.(Reporting by Aditi Shah; Writing by Nandan Mandayam; Editing
