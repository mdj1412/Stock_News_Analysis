SHANGHAI, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Chinese electric-vehicle
maker Nio Inc plans to build a factory to produce
budget EVs under a new brand for export to Europe from as early
as next year, three people with knowledge of the matter said.The plan to broaden the company's lineup and expand overseas
sales comes as EV sales sharply weaken in China, the world's
largest auto market, following an end in state subsidies for EV
purchases.Nio has been planning to launch more affordable EV products
under new brand names after 2024 as part of projects codenamed
"Firefly" and "Alps", according to the people, who declined to
be named as the discussions are private.The new factory will be built in Chuzhou city in eastern
China's Anhui province, they said, adding that the plant will
make cars, developed under project "Firefly", which Nio wants to
export to Europe where customers prefer small-sized vehicles.Nio already has two car assembly plants in Anhui's
provincial capital, Hefei city. The carmaker's prices in Europe
range from around 50,000 euros ($53,265) to 91,000 euros,
depending on the vehicle's range and whether customers buy or
rent the battery.The company did not immediately respond to a request for
comment. An official at the Chuzhou Economic and Technology
Development Zone, where the Nio plant is to be located, declined
to comment.Chinese media outlet Cailianshe first reported about the
development.Chinese EV players, most of which are still loss-making, are
ramping up efforts to increase their market share, as the usage
of EVs rises rapidly in China, where more than a quarter of the
new cars sold in January were either pure electric or plug-in
hybrids.While Tesla Inc relies on two models for the
majority of its sales in China, a strategy that helped keep
costs under control, many Chinese brands offer more models to
appeal to a wider consumer base.Nio offers six models and plans to launch five more this
year under the Nio brand. The Nio brand is positioned for the
premium segment to compete with BMW, Mercedes
and Audi.Nio Chairman William Li also said on Tuesday the company
will accelerate the expansion of its network of battery swapping
stations in China.
