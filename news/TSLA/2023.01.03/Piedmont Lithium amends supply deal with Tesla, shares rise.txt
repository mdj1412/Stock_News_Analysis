Jan 3 (Reuters) - Piedmont Lithium Inc said on
Tuesday it has amended its  deal with Tesla Inc to
supply spodumene concentrate, a key raw material for making
batteries, to the electric-car maker through 2025.Shares of Piedmont jumped 8% in premarket trading to $47.50
after the company announced the amemded deal.Under the new deal, the lithium miner will deliver about
125,000 metric tons of spodumene concentrate, or SC6, to Tesla
beginning in the second half of 2023 through the end of 2025,
from its project in Quebec.The amended agreement, which is binding for a three-year
term, includes an option to renew it for another three years.The initial September 2020 contract called for a fixed
commitment representing about one-third of Piedmont's planned
SC6 production of 160,000 tonnes per annum from its North
Carolina deposit, with a start date between July 2022 and July
2023.Piedmont said on Tuesday SC6 production is expected to
restart at the Quebec facility in the first half of 2023, with
first commercial shipments expected to begin in the third
quarter of the year.Tesla, meanwhile, is building a plant in Texas that will
convert Piedmont's SC6 into lithium hydroxide, a key building
block for EV batteries.
