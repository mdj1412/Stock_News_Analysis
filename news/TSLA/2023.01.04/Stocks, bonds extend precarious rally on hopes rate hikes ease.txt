*European, Asian stocks up 1% as 2023 optimism continues*Oil slides on lingering demand concerns*Dollar falls as euro bolstered by inflation dataLONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) -Shares rose and bonds rallied worldwide on Wednesday as
investors tiptoed into the new year with tentative optimism
after a brutal 2022, looking to encouraging inflation data for
hope that rate hikes might be less aggressive than feared.The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 1.15% by 1130
GMT as a lower inflation reading from France boosted sentiment,
building on positive data from Germany earlier in the week.Euro zone government bonds likewise extended their rally
from the first two trading days of 2023, with the benchmark
German 10 year yield sliding 10 basis points on
signs central banks are making progress against inflation.The yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell to
3.6809%, and 2-year Treasury yields, which typically
move in step with interest rate expectations, slipped 6 basis
points to 4.3409%.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside
Japan was 1.69% higher and set for a third
straight day of gains for the year, having fallen 20% in 2022,
its worst performance since 2008.The modest recovery in stocks and bonds showed optimism
about two of the factors that made 2022 such a hellish year for
investors, namely the constant drumbeat of rate hikes to fight
inflation and China's economy-throttling anti-COVID measures.But jitters in other assets showed the path ahead will be
far from smooth, as policymakers try to balance encouraging
economic growth with keeping a lid on inflation.Oil prices fell sharply, as concerns about global demand
persisted amid signs of weakening activity in the main engines
of growth such as the U.S., Europe and China."Fresh warnings about the effect of aggressive rate hikes on
the U.S. economy are rattling traders again, with the oil price
continuing its march downwards," said Susannah Streeter, senior
investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.U.S. crude fell 2.5% to $75.03 per barrel, while
Brent was at $80.09, down 2.42% on the day.FED UPThe positive market momentum in stocks on Wednesday was a
prelude to a key data release that could shift momentum back the
other way.Minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's December meeting,
when it cautioned rates may need to stay higher for longer, are
due to be released at 1900 GMT. Investors will parse the minutes
to figure out whether more policy tightening is likely, as well
as scanning U.S. job openings data at 1500 GMT."The market has made a pretty tentative start to the year
... (and) is still grappling with the notion of what we are
going to see from the Fed this year," said Rob Carnell, head of
ING's Asia-Pacific research."There are two camps out there and they are wrestling for
dominance in terms of the view. Some days higher-for-longer
wins, some days (the) higher-then-lower camp wins," Carnell
said.U.S. shares, which have started the year more tentatively
amid big falls in key stocks such as Tesla, looked set to open
with modest gains. E-mini futures for the S&P 500 rose
0.44%.The U.S. central bank said last month when it raised
interest rates by 50 basis points that the terminal rates may
need to remain higher for longer to fight inflation.Markets however are pricing in rate cuts for late 2023, with
fed fund futures implying a range of 4.25% to 4.5% by
December.Hopes for less aggressive rate hikes boosted non-yielding
gold, with spot prices for the precious metal hitting
$1,858 per ounce by 1148 GMT, their highest since mid-June.The dollar index, which measures the greenback
against six other currencies, meanwhile fell 0.6% as commodities
currencies like the Australian dollar gained and the euro rose
on the positive French and German inflation data.Sterling was last trading at $1.2055, up 0.74%, while
the euro rose 0.6% to $1.0610, coming off a three-week
low of $1.0519 touched overnight.The Japanese yen strengthened 0.12% versus the
greenback to 130.85 per dollar.(Reporting by Lawrence White and Ankur Banerjee; Editing by Sam
