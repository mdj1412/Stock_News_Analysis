LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Wednesday,
losing out to commodities currencies like the Australian dollar
and against the euro, which got a lift from a raft of data that
suggested European inflation may finally have peaked.The dollar was already under pressure from investors who
have grown more optimistic over the prospect that China's
relaxation of tough COVID restrictions will breathe life into
the world's second largest economy.Data on Wednesday showed French consumer price pressures
cooled by a lot more than expected in December, while the
previous day German data also showed inflation fell
significantly more than forecast. Spanish inflation data last
week painted a similar picture.The euro, which on Tuesday posted its largest one-day drop
against the dollar in two months, zipped up by as much as 0.82%,
as traders latched on to the idea that softer inflation might
mean a change in pace from the European Central Bank (ECB). This
in turn might suggest the economy will take less of a knock.A series of separate reports showed business sector activity
across the euro zone held up better than expected in December,
despite intense pressure from soaring energy prices."We're a day and a half into the trading year, so we can't
read too much into it, but the recent inflation figures in the
euro zone are coming down more quickly than expected," TraderX
market analyst Michael Brown said.The ECB in December sounded an unusually hawkish note,
indicating it may lift rates by another 150 basis points in
rapid succession.Wednesday's macro data has cast some doubt on this, Brown
said. "Thatâ€™s the big story markets are latching onto," he said.The euro was last up 0.5% against the dollar at
$1.0603 and up 0.3% against the yen at 138.55.The standout performer on Wednesday was the Australian
dollar, which roared as much as 2.3% higher against its
U.S. counterpart, on a combination of optimism over China and
following media reports that Beijing is discussing a possible
removal of a ban on coal imports from Australia.The Aussie was last up 2% at $0.6864, set for its largest
one-day gain in almost two months. The New Zealand dollar
rose 1.1% to $0.6315.The offshore yuan rose 0.47% against the dollar to
6.891, near its strongest for over four months.State media in China pledged a "final victory" over the
pandemic, boosting market bets that China's relaxation of rules
and reopening was irreversible.The yen gained 0.3% to around 130.66 against the
dollar, while sterling rose 0.7% to $1.2056.Later in the day, investors will scour minutes from the
Federal Reserve's most recent policy meeting for any additional
clues as to where interest rates might head, although monthly
employment figures on Friday will likely have more weight for
the market."The content of the minutes is easier to estimate than the
market reaction, with the prevailing narrative surrounding the
U.S. being so pessimistic most of the risk seems skewed to
further dollar weakness," David Stritch, a currency analyst at
CaxtonFX, said.(Additional reporting by Tom Westbrook in Singapore; Editing by
