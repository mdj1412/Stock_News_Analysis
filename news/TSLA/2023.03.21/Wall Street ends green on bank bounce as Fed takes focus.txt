sharply higher on Tuesday as widespread fears over liquidity in
the banking sector abated and market participants eyed the
Federal Reserve, which is expected to conclude its two-day
policy meeting on Wednesday with a 25 basis-point hike to its
policy rate.All three major U.S. stock indexes were bright green as the
session closed, with energy consumer discretionary
and financials enjoying the most sizable
gains.A one-two punch of regional bank failures last week,
followed by the rescue of First Republic Bank and the
takeover of Credit Suisse, sparked a rout in banking
stocks and fueled worries of contagion in the financial sector
which, in turn, heightened global anxieties over the growing
possibility of recession.But banking stocks bounced back on Tuesday,
building on Monday's reversal. Still, despite its recent
resurgence, the S&P Banks index has lost more than 18% of its
value just this month.Both the SPXBK and the KBW Regional Banking index
jumped 3.6% and 4.8%, respectively, their biggest one-day
percentage jumps since late last year."The stock market is coming to a recognition that the
banking crisis wasn't a crisis after all, and was isolated to a
handful of banks," said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at
Wealthspire Advisors in New York. "Both the public and the
private sector have shown they are more than able to backstop
and shore up weak institutions."Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, in prepared remarks before
the American Bankers Association, said the U.S. banking system
has stabilized due to decisive actions from regulators, but
warned more action might be required.Attention now shifts to the Fed, which has gathered for its
two-day monetary policy meeting, at which the members of the
Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) will revisit their
economic projections and, in all likelihood, implement another
increase to the Fed funds target rate in their ongoing battle
against inflation."The Fed will raise interest rates by 25 basis points and
the market won't care," Pursche added. "It will all be about
(Chairman Jerome) Powell's statement on the economy and
inflation, and if he can do a good enough job convincing the
public that the banking noise" can be attributed to bad
management on the part of a few banks.At last glance, financial markets have now priced in an
83.4% likelihood of a 25 basis-point rate hike, and a 16.6%
probability that the central bank will leave its policy rate
unchanged, according to CME's FedWatch tool.Economic data released early in the session showed a 14.5%
jump in existing home sales, blasting past expectations and
snapping a 12-month losing streak.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 316.02 points,
or 0.98%, to 32,560.6, the S&P 500 gained 51.3 points, or
1.30%, to 4,002.87 and the Nasdaq Composite added 184.57
points, or 1.58%, to 11,860.11.Eight of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 ended the
session in positive territory, with energy stocks, boosted by
rising crude prices, posting the largest percentage
gains.Shares of First Republic Bank soared by 29.5%, the
company's biggest-ever one-day percentage jump as JPMorgan CEO
Jamie Dimon leads talks with other big banks aimed at investing
in the lender, according to the Wall Street Journal.Peers PacWest Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp
also surged, leaping 18.8% and 15.0%, respectively.Tesla Inc advanced 7.8% after the electric
automaker appeared on track to report one of its best quarters
in China, according to car registration data.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a
3.22-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.73-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 5 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the
Nasdaq Composite recorded 48 new highs and 114 new lows.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.75 billion shares, compared
with the 12.63 billion average over the last 20 trading days.
