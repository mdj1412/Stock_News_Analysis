MEXICO CITY, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Mexico's president said
on Monday the northern Mexican state of Nuevo Leon, considered
the front-runner to land a major investment from Tesla Inc
, struggles with a lack of water and touted the benefits
of the poorer southern region where he has fought to boost
development.The comments come amid fears from some investors and
analysts that Mexico's geographic advantages as a nearshoring
destination for businesses looking to sell into the United
States are somewhat dampened by the heavy-handed influence of
the federal government.The state of Nuevo Leon at the U.S. border had emerged as
the top contender in Tesla's hunt for a site to open its first
plant in Mexico, yet President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said
the electric car producer has not yet made a final decision and
he would speak with company executives about the location."There are favorable conditions in Nuevo Leon. They have a
skilled workforce, they have engineers, it's very close to the
border," he told a news conference. "But the lack of water?"Lopez Obrador said he would emphasize to Tesla the need for
careful planning around water, electricity and other services,
noting certain northern zones ban water extraction while the
southeast holds 70% of Mexico's water."There's water, there's gas, there's electricity ... that's
part of what we want to make known," said the president, who is
slated to speak directly with Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk.Lopez Obrador has made it a priority to draw investment to
southern Mexico, which has lacked the level of industrialization
that has flourished along Mexico's northern border.His administration scored a victory last year when brewery
Constellation Brands opted to build in the southeastern state of
Veracruz, after a partly-built project in the arid northern city
of Mexicali was scrapped following Lopez Obrador's concerns over
water scarcity.Following Lopez Obrador's remarks on Monday, Nuevo Leon
Economy Minister Ivan Rivas said water access had not been an
issue for companies or held back investment, according to
Mexican outlet Milenio.(Reporting by Raul Cortes, Kylie Madry and Daina Beth Solomon;
