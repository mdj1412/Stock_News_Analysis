*Norway aims to end petrol and diesel car sales by 2025*Some 79% of cars sold in Norway in 2022 were fully
electric*Tesla Y most popular model*Government starts taxing EVs this year, raising doubtsOSLO, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Four out of five new cars sold
in Norway in 2022 were battery powered, led by Tesla, but some
in the industry say new taxes could thwart the country's goal of
becoming the first to end the sale of petrol and diesel
automobiles by 2025.Elon Musk's electric-only Tesla Inc. sold more cars
in Norway than any other brand for a second consecutive year,
clinching a 12.2% share of the overall market ahead of
Volkswagen with 11.6%, registration data showed.While China is by far the biggest car market overall, Norway
with its 5.5 million inhabitants, has achieved the world's
highest proportion of electric vehicles with the help of
generous subsidies, making it a proving ground for auto makers
launching models.The share of battery electric vehicles (BEV) sold rose to
79.3% of all new cars in 2022 from 65% in 2021, up from 2.9% a
decade ago, the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) said.The Tesla Model Y was the single most popular model of the
year, ahead of Volkswagen's electric ID.4 in second place, and
Skoda Enyaq in third.Seeking to end the sale of petrol and diesel cars,
oil-producing Norway has until now exempt battery electric
vehicles from taxes imposed on rivals using internal combustion
engines.But while tax exemptions help cut emissions, they cost the
state 39.4 billion crowns ($4.0 billion) in lost revenue in
2022, the finance ministry said, and the center-left coalition
government is seeking to curb benefits for high-end vehicles.Those who bought an electric Porsche Turbo S last year would
have paid at least 1.7 million Norwegian crowns, but if it had
been taxed like its petrol-fueled equivalent, the price tag
would have been above 2.1 million.A new auto tax based on weight could also negatively impact
the sale of BEVs as electric engine systems are heavier than
their fossil-fueled equivalents, said the Norwegian Automobile
Federation (NAF), an interest group representing car owners."We are concerned that the sales will drop because the
government has proposed a new tax based on weight," NAF
spokesperson Thor Egil Braadland said.The government has also failed to sufficiently address one
of the main practical problems for electric car owners, which
involves charging stations and how to pay for their use, he
said."You need 10-15 apps to be a well-prepared EV owner in
Norway, and we know that many are delaying their purchase of an
EV because of that," Braadland said.NAF is pushing for an 'e-roaming' solution that would enable
users to pay at all charging stations without needing multiple
apps.The government defended its policy for electric vehicles."The electric car has become the new normal car for
Norwegians, and that means we have to look into how we are using
society's funds," Labour's Johan Vasara, a state secretary at
the Norwegian transport ministry, said."We are very confident that the electric car is here to
stay," Vasara said, adding the government needs to focus its
measures on other transport segments, including heavy goods
vehicles.
