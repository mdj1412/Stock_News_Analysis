(Adds lawyer Porritt's reference to Musk's previous comments on
Tesla stake, in paragraph 4, and background in paragraph 5)SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Elon Musk told jurors
on Monday he was sure he had locked up financial support from
Saudi investors in 2018 to take his electric car maker Tesla Inc
private, and could even have used his stake in rocket
company SpaceX to fund a buyout.At a trial in San Francisco federal court, the billionaire,
who said he was tired from a lack of sleep, spoke quietly and
calmly during roughly five hours of testimony."With SpaceX stock alone, I felt funding was secured" for
the buyout, he told a jury, referring to the aerospace company
where he is also CEO, without giving any details.But Nicholas Porritt, the plaintiff investors' lawyer,
raised doubts about whether he had been looking to use his
SpaceX stake to fund the deal, which would have increased his
stake in Tesla. Porritt pointed out that Musk had told Tesla
employees at the time he expected his stake in Tesla to remain
similar after the deal.Musk is defending against claims that he defrauded investors
by tweeting on Aug. 7, 2018, that he had "funding secured" to
take Tesla private at $420 per share, and that "investor support
is confirmed." Musk added later that he chose not to take Tesla
private due to a lack of support from some investors and a wish
to avoid a lengthy process.The trial tests Musk's penchant for taking to Twitter to air
his sometimes irreverent views, and when the world's
second-richest person can be held liable for crossing a line.Tesla's stock price surged after Musk's 2018 tweets, only to
fall as it became clear the buyout would not happen. Investors
say they lost millions of dollars as a result.Musk told Porritt that he met on July 31, 2018, with
representatives of Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the
Public Investment Fund, at Tesla's factory in Fremont,
California.He acknowledged that a takeover price was not discussed, but
said the Saudi representatives made clear they would do what it
took to make a buyout happen.That never came to pass, Musk said, because the fund's
governor, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, later backpedaled on the commitment
to take Tesla private."I was very upset because he had been unequivocal in his
support for taking Tesla private when we met and now he appeared
to be backpedaling," Musk testified.Lawyers for Al-Rumayyan did not immediately return a request
for comment.Porritt later told the court that written evidence did not
support Musk's claim about the Saudis' original intentions,
saying that minutes of their meeting showed that the Saudis
wanted to learn more about what Musk had in mind.Musk later testified that he would have sold his stake in
SpaceX to fund the go-private deal, as he sold part of his Tesla
stake to help fund his bid to take Twitter private last year.He is expected to continue on Tuesday with a third day of
testimony.'NOT A JOKE'A jury of nine will decide whether the Tesla CEO
artificially inflated the company's share price by touting the
buyout's prospects, and if so by how much.Musk testified that when tweeting about the financing, he
was saying "not that it will happen, but that I am thinking
about it," and that it was his "opinion" that funding was
secured.U.S. Judge Edward Chen ruled last May that Musk's post was
untruthful and reckless.Musk has also been sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission over the tweets, leading to a combined $40 million in
settlements for him and Tesla and a requirement that a Tesla
lawyer screen some of his tweets in advance.The SEC had alleged that Musk rounded the alleged buyout
offer to $420 per share from $419 because he had recently
learned about the higher amount's "significance in marijuana
culture" and thought his girlfriend would find it funny.Musk denied having thought that."It was chosen because it was a 20% premium over the stock
price," he testified. "The $420 price was not a joke."He began testifying on Friday, telling jurors that while
Twitter, which he bought in October, was the most democratic way
to communicate, his tweets did not always affect Tesla stock the
way he expects."Just because I tweet something does not mean people believe
it or will act accordingly," Musk said.The defendants also include current and former Tesla
directors, whom Musk's lawyer Alex Spiro said had "pure" motives
in their response to Musk's plan.(Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco and Jody Godoy in
