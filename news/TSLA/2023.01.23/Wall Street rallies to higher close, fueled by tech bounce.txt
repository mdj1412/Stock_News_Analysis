Salesforce*Chips surge on Barclay's upgradeNEW YORK, Jan 23 (Reuters) -Wall Street ended sharply higher on Monday, powered by
surging technology stocks as investors began an earnings-heavy
week with a renewed enthusiasm for market leading momentum
stocks that were battered last year.All three major stock indexes extended Friday's rally,
gaining altitude as the day progressed. The tech-heavy Nasdaq
led the pack, boosted by semiconductor shares."(Chips are) a group that's been depressed, so I’m not
too surprised," said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment
Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. "We're going to see
earnings from these companies over the next couple of weeks and
that will be where the rubber meets the road.""It’s a group that was ripe for a rebound."The session marks a calm before the storm in a week
jam-packed with high profile earnings reports and back-end
loaded with crucial economic data.Investors are all but certain the Federal Reserve will
implement a bite-sized interest rate hike next week even as the
U.S. central bank remains committed to taming the hottest
inflationary cycle in decades."(Investors) are pretty comfortable that they’re going
to see lower rate hikes from the Fed, that we are rounding the
corner on inflation and interest rate hikes," Tuz added. "Stocks
can do well in that environment, especially the big growth
stocks that drive the market."Financial markets have priced in a 99.8% likelihood of a 25
basis point hike to the Fed funds target rate at the conclusion
of its two-day monetary policy meeting next Wednesday, according
to CME's FedWatch tool.According to preliminary data, the S&P 500

while the Nasdaq Composite gained 223.34 points, or
2.00%, to 11,363.77. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
rose 252.36 points, or 0.76%, to 33,627.85.The fourth-quarter reporting season has shifted into
overdrive, with 57 of the companies in the S&P 500 having posted
results. Of those, 63% have delivered better-than-expected
earnings, according to Refinitiv.Analysts now see S&P 500 fourth-quarter earnings, on
aggregate, dropping 3% year-on-year, nearly twice as steep as
the 1.6% annual drop seen at the beginning of the year, per
Refinitiv.This week, Microsoft Corp and Tesla Inc,
along with a spate of heavy-hitting industrials including Boeing
CO, 3M Co, Union Pacific Corp, Dow Inc
, and Northrop Grumman Corp, are expected to post
quarterly results.The Philadelphia SE semiconductor index posted sharp
gains after Barclays upgraded the sector to "overweight" from
"equal weight."Tesla surged 7.8% as Chief Executive Elon Musk took the
stand in his fraud trial related to a tweet saying he had
backing to take the electric automaker private.Baker Hughes Co missed quarterly profit estimates
due to inflation pressures and ongoing disruptions due to
Russia's war on Ukraine.Cloud-based software firm Salesforce Inc jumped
following news that activist investor Elliot Management Corp has
taken a multi-billion dollar stake in the company.Spotify Technology SA joined the growing list of
tech-related companies to announce impending job cuts, shedding
6% of its workforce as rising interest rates and the looming
possibility of recession continue to pressure growth stocks.On the economic front, the U.S. Commerce Department is
expected to unveil its initial "advance" take on fourth-quarter
GDP on Thursday, which analysts expect to land at 2.5%.On Friday, the wide-ranging personal consumption
expenditures (PCE) report is due to shed light on consumer
spending, income growth, and crucially, inflation.
