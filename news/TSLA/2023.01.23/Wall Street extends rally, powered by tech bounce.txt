stocks that were battered last year.All three major stock indexes extended Friday's gains,
with the tech-heavy Nasdaq leading the pack, boosted by
semiconductor shares."(Chips are) a group that's been depressed, so I’m not

Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. "We're going to see
earnings from these companies over the next couple of weeks and
that will be where the rubber meets the road.""It’s a group that was ripe for a rebound."The session marks a calm before the storm in a week
jam-packed with high profile earnings reports and back-end

inflationary cycle in decades."(Investors) are pretty comfortable that they’re going
to see lower rate hikes from the Fed, that we are rounding the
corner on inflation and interest rate hikes," Tuz added. "Stocks
can do well in that environment, especially the big growth
stocks that drive the market."Financial markets have priced in a 99.9% likelihood of a 25
