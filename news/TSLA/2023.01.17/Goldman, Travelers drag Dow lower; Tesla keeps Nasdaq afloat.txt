1% on Tuesday as weak earnings from Goldman Sachs dragged the
index lower, but a jump in Tesla shares helped keep the
benchmark S&P 500 and Nasdaq near the unchanged mark.Goldman Sachs Group Inc slumped 6.91% and was poised
for its biggest one-day percentage drop since June 2020 after
the bank reported a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly
profit. The decline in Goldman shares, the second-most expensive
of the Dow Industrials, pulled the price-weighted index lower as
the biggest drag.For a price-weighted index such as the Dow, the share value
of a stock is proportional to its contribution in the index, in
contrast to the market capitalization-weighted S&P 500.Also weighing on the blue-chip Dow index was insurer
Travelers Cos Inc, which slumped 4.8% after forecasting
fourth-quarter earnings below estimates.But a 6.52% jump in Tesla Inc helped keep the S&P
500 and Nasdaq afloat. The electric-vehicle maker's January
retail sales surged in China following recent price cuts on its
top-selling models, data from China Merchants Bank International
showed.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 353.76 points,
or 1.03%, to 33,948.85, the S&P 500 lost 6.98 points, or
0.17%, to 3,992.11 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.28
points, or 0.06%, to 11,085.44.Morgan Stanley climbed 6.86% as it beat analysts'
estimates for fourth-quarter profit as its trading business got
a boost from market volatility.Earnings from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley close out
what was a mixed bag for big banks, many of which have stashed
rainy-day funds to gird against a potential recession.Analysts expect year-over-year earnings from S&P 500
companies to decline 2.4% for the quarter, according to
Refinitiv data, compared with a 1.6% decline at the start of the
year.Data showed New York state manufacturing contracted sharply
in January as orders collapsed and employment growth stalled,
pointing to continued weakness in national factory activity,
fueling recession concerns.Equity markets have gotten off to a strong start this year
after a dismal performance in 2022, on hopes that easing
inflation and a slowdown in the economy, especially the labor
market, would give the Federal Reserve the leeway to scale back
the size of interest rate hikes it has used to combat high
prices.The Dow was on track to snap a four-session win streak,
while the Nasdaq was on pace for its seventh straight gain, its
longest streak since November 2021.Money market participants are currently expecting a 25-basis
point interest rate hike from the U.S. central bank in February
and see rates peaking at 4.9% in June, while the Fed's
projections are for over 5%.U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies declined, with
JD.Com Inc down 6.01% and Baidu Inc off 6.45%
after China's economic growth in 2022 slumped to one of its
worst levels in nearly half a century.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a
1.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.00-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and one new low; the
Nasdaq Composite recorded 85 new highs and nine new lows.
