A Dec. 31 tweet suggested drivers with more than 10,000 miles using Tesla's "Full Self-Driving" system should be able to disable the "steering wheel nag," an alert that instructs drivers to hold the wheel to confirm they are paying attention. Musk responded: "Agreed, update coming in Jan." NHTSA said Monday it "is in contact with Tesla to gather additional information." The Associated Press reported NHTSA's statement earlier.
