SHANGHAI, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Prospective Tesla Inc
buyers in China are waiting longer for certain versions
of its Model Y car, suggesting the electric-vehicle maker's
decision to cut prices is stoking demand in its second-largest
market.Tesla cut prices by 6% to 13.5% on Friday, bringing some of
its auto prices to near BYD's best-selling models in a
step analysts said was a sign that a price war could be building
as demand in China has faltered.The waiting time for orders of the rear-wheel-drive and
long-range versions of Model Y were a week longer on Monday than
on Friday, Tesla's website showed. The wait as of Monday was two
to five weeks on those models. The wait time for all versions of
the Model 3 and the performance version of the Model Y remained
at one to four weeks as of Monday."It (the wait time) is an early indication that the price
cuts are having their intended impact, which is to boost
demand," said CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson.The company's shares rose about 6% to close at $119.77 on
Monday after losing 68% over the past 12 months. It was the most
actively traded stock on U.S. exchanges, with more than 228
million shares changing hands.As of Monday, Tesla had not made any adjustment to its
January production plan for its Shanghai plant, with suspension
of the assembly lines to start from Jan. 20 through the end of
the month, a person with knowledge of the matter said.Nelson added that Tesla's vehicle production has exceeded
sales for three straight quarters and the company has chosen to
lower prices and take some additional downtime at the Shanghai
factory to bring supply and demand back in balance.Angry Chinese owners who bought Tesla cars in late 2022 and
missed out on the additional discount said they were waiting for
a response from the company for their demand for some kind of
compensation after a flurry of impromptu protests.A Tesla representative told Reuters on Saturday that the
company has no plan to compensate those buyers for price cuts
they had missed. The company did not respond to a request for
comment on Monday.Some of the buyers in China said they had been led to
believe that the further discounts would not be coming. Many
were also looking to take advantage of a nationwide EV subsidy
that expired at year end.Chinese state media have largely opted not to cover the
protests, which online videos showed happened in cities
including Beijing, Shenzhen, Chengdu and Xi'an. Reuters
witnessed a protest at a Tesla facility in Shanghai.Comments on Chinese social media were largely negative
toward the Tesla buyers who have protested, with many saying
online they should have understood the terms of the contract.Separately, Tesla as of Monday began offering discounts to
buyers in Singapore who agreed to purchase existing inventory,
adding that market to China, South Korea, Japan and Australia to
those where it has offered new incentives.(Reporting by Zhang Yan, Brenda Goh; Additional reporting by
