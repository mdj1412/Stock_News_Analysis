              Jan 18 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes closed
lower on Wednesday after weak economic data and hawkish comments
from Federal Reserve officials sparked worries that the central
bank will keep tightening policy, perhaps enough to cause a
recession.Before the market opened, U.S. economic data showed retail
sales and producer prices declined more than expected in
December. Also production at U.S. factories fell more than
expected in December and output in the prior month was weaker
than previously thought."It seems that investors are finally coming to the
conclusion that getting inflation under control is not a free
lunch and that all the tightening the Fed has had to do to get
inflation moving in the right direction, comes with economic
costs," said Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment
strategy at Glenmede."Investors may have had this false belief that this soft
landing scenario was a higher probability event than it actually
is."According to preliminary data, the S&P 500
lost 62.12 points, or 1.56%, to end at 3,928.85 points,
while the Nasdaq Composite lost 138.17 points, or 1.25%,
to 10,956.95. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
fell 615.67 points, or 1.81%, to 33,296.63.With Wall Street's major averages showing gains so far for
2023, Sam Stovall, chief investment  strategist at CFRA
research, said some investors saw the week data as an
opportunity to take profits."The market was overbought. Today's economic data served
as a trigger to initiate a profit taking spell and the groups
with most profits to take have been the ones that have done best
last year," said Stovall.Earlier, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Cleveland
Fed President Loretta Mester stressed on the need to raise rates
beyond 5% to bring inflation to heel.The Fed commentary also highlighted the disparity between
the U.S. central bank's estimate of its terminal rate and market
expectations, which were of the rate peaking at 4.88% by June.
Traders are now betting on a 25-basis point rate hike in
February.Investors are also focused on the fourth-quarter earnings
season as a window into how corporate America is doing against
the backdrop of higher interest rates.Analysts now expect year-over-year earnings from S&P 500
companies to decline 2.6% for the quarter, according to
Refinitiv data, compared with a 1.6% decline in the beginning of
the year.IBM Corp shares were in the red after Morgan Stanley
downgraded the company's shares to "equal weight" from
"overweight".Moderna Inc shares rose after reporting data which
demonstrated the effectiveness of its respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV) vaccine.PNC Financial Services Group Inc shares tumbled
after the company missed estimates for its fourth-quarter
profit.
