PARIS, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Renault group sales
in 2022 fell 5.9% to 2,051,174 vehicles, marking a fourth
consecutive annual decline after capacity constraints and supply
chain snags, the company said on Wednesday.The group, which is in the middle of a turnaround, said its
order book in Europe was at a record level of 3.5 months of
sales.A day after publishing a 9.4% decline in 2022 sales for its
flagship Renault brand, it said that had been partly offset by
the performance of its low-cost brand Dacia, which posted a 6.8%
increase in sales.The French carmaker, which was hit harder than most rivals
by the COVID-19 crisis and a global chip shortage, is betting on
higher-margin and electric cars to boost profits.It said on Tuesday that the Renault brand, which accounts
for two-thirds of group sales, was the third European brand for
electrified vehicle sales behind Toyota  and Tesla
with 228,000 units sold, an increase of 12% from 2021.The company says it is starting the year with a better
portfolio and higher stocks, giving it confidence it can return
to sales growth in 2023.But its executives have acknowledged that global price cuts
announced recently by Tesla were an issue that Renault - like
rivals - would have to contend with.Separately, the sales head at Renault's premium sports brand
Alpine said the brand aims to maintain strong sales growth of
its sole car currently on offer, the A110 premium sedan, in
2023."We are going to increase production by about 20%", Emmanuel
Al Nawakil told journalists on Wednesday.The brand, whose sales jumped by 33% in 2022, said it
will also rely upon additional models in the coming years to
pump up volumes - a small electric city car from 2024, followed
by a compact SUV in 2025 and a new version of the A110.It is also exploring the possibility of launching two
larger SUVs, probably electric.In November, Renault announced a major overhaul that will
see it separate its activities into five businesses, deepen ties
with China's Geely and spin off its electric vehicles unit
through a stock market listing this year. It is also in talks
with Japanese partner Nissan to restructure their
long-standing alliance.
