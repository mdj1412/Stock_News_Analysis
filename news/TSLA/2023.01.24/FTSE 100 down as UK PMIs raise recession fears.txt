(Alliance News) - Stock prices were mixed at midday in London, as investors digested a poor set of PMI readings for the UK, which may indicate that the country is heading into recession.The FTSE 100 index was down 35.43 points, 0.5%, at 7,749.24. The FTSE 250 was up 38.0 points, 0.2%, at 19,882.00, and the AIM All-Share was up 2.56 points, 0.3%, at 861.64.The Cboe UK 100 was down 0.4% at 776.25, the Cboe UK 250 up 0.4% at 17,348.70, and the Cboe Small Companies down 0.1% at 13,984.21.In European equities on Tuesday, the CAC 40 index in Paris was down 0.1%, and the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was down 0.4%.There was a slew of flash purchasing managers' index readings across Europe early Tuesday, with results mixed.The UK private sector saw the sharpest drop in business activity in two years this month.The S&P Global CIPS composite PMI fell to a 24-month low of 47.8 points in January, from 49.0 in December. Falling further beneath the 50-point no-change mark, it shows the contraction in the UK's private sector has worsened at the start of 2023.The deterioration was led by a fall in the services sector, with the flash services PMI falling to 48.0 in January from 49.9 in December. This was worse than FXStreet-cited consensus, which had expected the reading to remain the same as the previous month."Weaker than expected PMI numbers in January underscore the risk of the UK slipping into recession. Industrial disputes, staff shortages, export losses, the rising cost of living and higher interest rates all meant the rate of economic decline gathered pace again at the start of the year," said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.In more optimistic news, the eurozone's private sector edged back into growth territory in January.The composite PMI rose to a seven-month high of 50.2 points from 49.3 in December. The reading came in higher than the FXStreet-cited consensus of 49.8 points.S&P Global said the steadying of the eurozone adds to evidence that the region might escape recession. Williamson said the survey suggested "a nadir was reached back in October, since when fears over the energy market in particular have been alleviated by falling prices, helped by the warmer than usual weather and generous government assistance".Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management commented: "Following better data, lower gas prices and China's reopening, the euro area's growth prospects had thought to have improved significantly, and US investors slid huge blocks of risk outside the US, where Europe was a prime destination after the continent was supposed to have skirted recession thanks to Mother Nature."He added: "However, the mixed yet still soggy PMI data brings today's EU feel-good into question. At least at the survey level, the China reopening hasn't caught the European industrial heartland by...storm yet."The pound was quoted at USD1.2319 at midday on Tuesday in London, down from USD1.2368 at the close on Monday.
