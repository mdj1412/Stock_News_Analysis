choppy trade on Thursday as cooling inflation supported bets of
smaller interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, though
concerns remained that the central bank was not close to pausing
its monetary tightening.The Labor Department's report showed U.S. consumer prices
grew 6.5% on an annual basis in December, in line with
expectations. While it was the smallest rise since October 2021
and followed a 7.1% advance in November, the headline inflation
number remains above the Fed's 2% target.Wall Street's main indexes swung between gains and losses
after the inflation report, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq
falling over 1% earlier in the session."The number is clearly trending in the right direction, but
not very quickly. So the battle between the bulls and the bears
continues," said Dennis Dick, market structure analyst and
trader at Triple D Trading.The Fed raised the key rate by 50 basis points in December,
after four back-to-back 75-bps hikes, but also indicated a
prolonged period of rate hikes to above 5% in 2023.A separate report showed weekly jobless claims fell last
week, signaling a still tight labor market."The Fed now has the opportunity to moderate further
increases (but) the numbers certainly don't point to a stoppage
of any increases," said Mike Loewengart, head of model portfolio
construction at Morgan Stanley Global Investment Office in New
York.Traders' bets of a 25-basis point rate hike by the Fed in
February shot up to 91% after the inflation data, from 77%
previously.Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker and St. Louis Fed
President James Bullard acknowledged the moderation in prices,
but stressed on the need for further monetary policy tightening
to bring inflation down to the central bank's target.Consumer prices had been on a downward trend after peaking
in June, with markets hoping that continued moderation in the
latest inflation print may persuade the Fed to soon signal a
pause in its rate-hiking cycle.Such optimism has supported equities in 2023, with the S&P
500 up 3.5% so far this year.This week also marks the start of the quarterly earnings
season, with big banks expected to report lower profits, while
overall S&P 500 earnings are expected to decline year-over-year,
according to Refinitiv.At 12:02 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 was up 8.51 points, or
0.21%, at 3,978.12, and the Nasdaq Composite was up
21.37 points, or 0.20%, at 10,953.04.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 182.66
points, or 0.54%, at 34,155.67, supported by gains in industrial
stocks such as Boeing Co and Caterpillar Inc.Among major S&P 500 sectors, energy stocks led
gains, rising 2% as oil prices climbed.Tesla Inc slid 1.7% following a report that the
electric-car maker delayed plans to expand its Shanghai factory.American Airlines Group Inc advanced 5.7% after
raising its fourth-quarter profit forecast.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 2.62-to-1 ratio
on the NYSE and a 1.74-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The S&P index recorded eight new 52-week highs and one new
low, while the Nasdaq recorded 62 new highs and 13 new lows.
