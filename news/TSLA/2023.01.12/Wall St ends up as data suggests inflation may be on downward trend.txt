points, or 0.64%, to 34,189.97, the S&P 500 gained 13.55

added 69.43 points, or 0.64%, to 11,001.11.The S&P 500 is now up 3.7% for the year so far."The (CPI) report confirms that inflation is in a downward
trend and that it has reversed," said Peter Cardillo, chief
market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker and St. Louis Fed
President James Bullard acknowledged the moderation in prices,
but stressed on the need for further monetary policy tightening
to bring inflation down to the central bank's target.The Fed raised the key rate by 50 basis points in December,
