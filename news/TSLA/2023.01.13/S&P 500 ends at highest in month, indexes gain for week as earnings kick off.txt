rainy-day funds to prepare for a possible recession and reported
weak investment banking results while showing caution about
forecasting income growth. They said higher rates helped to
boost profits.Strategists said investors will be watching for further
guidance from company executives in the coming weeks."This has shifted the focus back to earnings," said Peter
Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville,
Virginia."Even though the earnings were basically OK, people are just
kind of stepping back, and you're going to see a wait-and-see
attitude with stocks" as investors hear more from company
executives.Year-over-year earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected
to have declined 2.2% for the quarter, according to Refinitiv
data.Also giving some support to the market Friday, the

have bolstered hopes that a sustained downward trend in
inflation could give the Federal Reserve room to dial back on
its interest rate hikes.Money market participants now see a 91.6% chance the Fed
will hike the benchmark rate by 25 basis points in February.Among the day's decliners, Tesla shares fell 0.9%
after it slashed prices on its electric vehicles in the United
