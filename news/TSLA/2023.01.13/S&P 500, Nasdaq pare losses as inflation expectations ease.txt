0.34%Jan 13 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq pared
losses on Friday on the back of easing inflation expectations
and better-than-feared results from some U.S. banks, while gains
in UnitedHealth kept the Dow afloat.The University of Michigan's survey on Friday showed an
improvement in U.S. consumer sentiment, with one-year inflation
outlook falling in January to the lowest level since the spring
of 2021.This comes a day after U.S. consumer prices fell for the
first time in more than 2-1/2 years in December, fueling hopes
that a sustained downward trend in price pressures could give
the Federal Reserve cover to scale down the size of its interest
rate hikes.Money market participants see a 91.6% chance the Fed will
hike the benchmark rate by 25 basis points in February, but see
the terminal rate at 4.9% by June.On the earnings front, major U.S. banks stockpiled more
rainy-day funds to prepare for a possible recession and reported
weak investment banking results, but said consumers remained
healthy and higher rates boosted profits.JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp
, which beat quarterly profit estimates, reversed early
declines to gain 1.2% and 0.6%, respectively."There were no disastrous (bank) reports," said Art Hogan,
chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial."Combine that with the fact the University of Michigan
consumer sentiment is stronger than expected, that paints the
picture of an economy that may be slowing, but certainly not
crashing."Wells Fargo & Co and Citigroup Inc fell short
of quarterly profit estimates.Earnings from the big banks, which kicked off the quarterly
reporting season, had been awaited in earnest for clues on
outlook for the U.S. economy amid worries that the Fed's
aggressive monetary tightening would lead to a recession.Meanwhile, Tesla Inc slipped 3.8% after slashing
prices on its electric vehicles in the United States and Europe
by as much as 20% after missing 2022 deliveries estimates.Most major S&P 500 sector indexes were in the red.
Healthcare stocks bucked the trend with a 0.4% rise.Keeping the pressure off the Dow, UnitedHealth Group Inc
rose 2% after beating Wall Street expectations for
fourth-quarter profit.Hopes of a less hawkish monetary policy stance by the Fed
have supported equities in 2023, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq
and the benchmark S&P 500 up 4.8% and 3.4%,
respectively, this year.At 11:43 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
was up 23.61 points, or 0.07%, at 34,213.58, the S&P 500
was down 12.44 points, or 0.31%, at 3,970.73, and the Nasdaq
Composite was down 37.82 points, or 0.34%, at 10,963.28.Delta Air Lines Inc dropped 4.1% as the company
forecast first-quarter profit below expectations.Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.05-to-1 ratio
on the NYSE and a 1.07-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The S&P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and two new
lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 66 new highs and six new lows.
