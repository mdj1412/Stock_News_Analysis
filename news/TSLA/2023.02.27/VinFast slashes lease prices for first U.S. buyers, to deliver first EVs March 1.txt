HANOI, Feb 27 (Reuters) -Vietnamese electric vehicle maker VinFast has cut the lease
price for its first model shipped to the United States by more
than 50% for its first customers in California, with delivery
starting this week, according to the company and emails to
customers reviewed by Reuters.VinFast, a subsidiary of conglomerate Vingroup JSC,
had said in January its first VF8 all-electric crossovers would
be available to lease at a monthly payment of $599 for 24
months.Its website showed as of Monday a monthly lease price of
$399 for the vehicle for a 24-month lease.VinFast told people who had already paid a refundable
deposit on the car that the payment would be $274 per month in
California, the first U.S. state to receive the vehicles,
according to messages to those potential buyers reviewed by
Reuters.That amounts to a discount of between 33% and 54% from the
initially advertised monthly lease price."This is our special offer to VinFast customers for the
VF 8 City Edition models in order to stay competitive with other
brands," VinFast said in a statement."We will officially deliver the VF 8 City Edition
vehicles to customers on March 1," it said, without specifying
the number of units in the 999 batchshippedto California late last year.The move represents the latest sign of increased price
competition by EV makers. Tesla, the global EV leader,
cut prices globally by up to 20% in January, although it has
increased prices on some models and in some markets by smaller
margins since.The Biden administration's EV credits, which took effect at
the start of the year, have also changed the calculus for
automakers and U.S. consumers.Electric vehicles like those made by Tesla in North America
qualify for a consumer tax credit of $7,500. Businesses,
including the finance companies that underwrite car leases, can
also claim a credit of up to $7,500 for EVs if the cars are sold
by one of the companies certified by the IRS.VinFast was not listed as one of the 39 "qualified
manufacturers" on the IRS list as of Monday.VinFast said earlier this month that US Bancorp
would provide lease financing for the company's sales in the
United States.Vehicle subscription service Autonomy has a deal with
VinFast to purchase 2,500 EVs, the companies said in November.In a separate statement, VinFast's chairwoman Le Thi Thu
Thuy said VinFast expected to deliver EVs in Canada, France,
Germany and the Netherlands, following its deliveries in the
U.S. market.The VF 8 City Edition comes in both Eco and Plus trim
with an EPA-rated range of 207 miles (333 km) and 191 miles (307
km) respectively, the company said.The company has filed for an initial public offering in the
United States and plans to build an EV assembly factory in North
Carolina.
