their biggest percentage declines of the year on worries about
the impact of a tighter monetary policy.The blue-chip Dow erased its gains for the year in

starting point," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B

better-than-expected economic data pushed yields higher. As we
enter the new week, we see that the yields are calming down a
bit."The yield on two-year Treasury notes, the most
sensitive to short-term rate expectations, slipped after
touching a near four-month high earlier.Traders raised their bets of a 50-basis-point (bps) hike in

Expenditures price index, the metric by which the Fed measures
its 2% inflation target, rose 5.4% last month.Fed fund futures show traders are pricing in a third 25 bps
hikes this year and see rates peaking at 5.4% by September.Morgan Stanley said it expects the Fed to cut rates by March
