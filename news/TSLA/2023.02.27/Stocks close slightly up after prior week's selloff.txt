declines of 2023 for Wall Street's main benchmarks, as jitters
persisted about coming interest rate hikes to tame stubbornly
high inflation.All three main stock indexes climbed more than 1% shortly

three-week losing streak for the S&P since December, a little
green is a welcome change but again the reality is market
participants are trying to square the circle with exactly how
long the Fed will leave rates high, and is a 50 basis point hike
really on the table at the next meeting," said Ryan Detrick,
chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha, Nebraska."Itâ€™s led to a good deal of uncertainty, and we have seen

percentage since September, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each had
their biggest weekly percentage fall since December as economic

March with a half-point hike. Morgan Stanley said it no longer
sees a cut by the Fed this year and expects a slower pace of 25
basis points when the central bank does begin lowering rates.Fed funds futures show traders are pricing in a third 25 bps
