SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 15 (Reuters) -Tesla Inc will open part of its U.S. charging
network to electric vehicles (EVs) made by rivals as part of a
$7.5 billion federal program to expand the use of EVs and cut
carbon emissions.The move could help turn Tesla into the universal "filling
station" of the EV era - and risk eroding a competitive edge for
vehicles made by the company, which has exclusive access to the
biggest network of high-speed Superchargers in the United
States.By late 2024, Tesla would open 3,500 new and existing
Superchargers along highway corridors to non-Tesla customers,
the Biden administration said. It would also offer 4,000 slower
chargers at locations like hotels and restaurants.Biden wrote on Twitter that the plan to open a "big part" of
Tesla's network to all drivers was a "big deal" and would "make
a big difference."In response, Tesla Chief Executive Musk said, "Thank you, Tesla is happy to support other EVs via our
Supercharger network."A White House official said at a briefing that Tesla would
be eligible for a subsidy - including retrofitting its existing
fleet - as long as its chargers allowed other vehicles with a
federally backed charging standard called CCS to charge.The administration said Tesla had not committed to adopting
CCS as its standard, but it must comply with the requirements to
qualify for federal funds.Tesla has 17,711 Superchargers, accounting for about 60% of
total U.S. fast chargers, which can add hundreds of miles of
driving range in an hour or less. There are also nearly 10,000
"destination" chargers with Tesla plugs that can recharge a
vehicle overnight.Opening up access to Tesla's network would be a quick win
for an ambitious federal program to build 500,000 EV chargers by
2030, up from 130,000 currently."Select Tesla Superchargers across the US will soon be open
to all EVs," Tesla wrote on Twitter, without elaborating on
when, where and how it would open its chargers. It had already
planned to more than double its U.S. Supercharger network by the
end of 2024, it said.PLUG AND PAYCompanies that hoped to tap the federal funding for this
network must also use standardized payment options that require
a single method of identification that works across all
chargers, the administration said.All EV drivers would be able to access these stations using
the Tesla app or website, it said.Adding non-Tesla owners may require a different plug and
payment method."Tesla does have a hardware and a software solution" to
allow for CCS, the White House official said.Investors and U.S. EV enthusiasts have been waiting for
action on chargers from Musk, who said in 2021 that the point of
his charging network was "not to create a walled garden and use
that to bludgeon our competitors." The company has opened some
Superchargers in Europe and Australia to non-Tesla owners since
2021.Analysts said the amount of federal funds at stake meant
Musk had to either act on the plan or risk other charging
companies, such as EVgo Inc and ChargePoint Holdings
Inc, taking the market."The amount of money involved in the National Electric
Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program provides a strong
incentive for Tesla to adapt its strategy to include the
installation of CCS ports," said Sam Houston, senior vehicles
analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists.Chris Harto, a senior policy analyst at Consumer Reports,
said, "There is no doubt the $7.5 billion in federal charging
investment threatens Tesla's competitive advantage. That is
actually the entire point of the program."Opening up its networks could expand funding and revenue for
Tesla, but could also erode the brand's exclusivity and make it
challenging for the automaker to manage the network, analysts
said."There is a strong likelihood that if they open the
Supercharger network to other vehicles, their current excellent
reliability rate will decline significantly," said Guidehouse
Insights analyst Sam Abuelsamid.(Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco and Jarrett Renshaw
