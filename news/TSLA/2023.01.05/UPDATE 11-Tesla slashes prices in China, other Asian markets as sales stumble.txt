*Tesla's first major move since Zhu appointment to oversee
output*Prices down 13% to 24% from Sept in China - Reuters
calculations*EV maker also cuts prices in Japan, South Korea and
AustraliaSHANGHAI, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Tesla cut prices in
China for the second time in less than three months on Friday,
fuelling forecasts of a wider price war amid weaker demand in
the world's largest autos market.The U.S. automaker also cut prices on its best-selling Model
Y and Model 3 electric vehicles in Japan, South Korea and
Australia in what a person with direct knowledge of the plan
said was part of an effort to help stoke demand for output from
its Shanghai factory, its single largest production hub.The shift is the first major move by Tesla since appointing
its lead executive for China and Asia, Tom Zhu, to oversee
global output and deliveries that have been at the heart of the
company's recent challenges after falling short of its 2022
delivery target.Tesla shares closed up 2.5% at $113.06 on Friday.
However, the stock has lost 70% of its value in the last year.Automakers have long turned to incentives to control
inventory, but, until late last year, Tesla had been able to
keep prices steady or even raise them due to strong orders.But last month CEO Elon Musk said "radical interest rate
changes" had affected the affordability of all cars, new and
used, and that Tesla could cut prices to sustain volume growth.The latest cut in China, along with another in October and
recent incentives for Chinese buyers, mean a 13% to 24%
reduction in Tesla's prices from September in its second-largest
market after the United States, Reuters calculations showed.Tesla slashed prices for all its Model 3 and Model Y cars in
China by between 6% to 13.5%, according to Reuters calculations
based on the website prices. The starting price for the Model 3
was cut to 229,900 yuan ($33,427), from 265,900 yuan. Those
models are now priced 24% to 32% lower than those in the United
States, Tesla's largest market, Reuters calculations showed,
reflecting several factors including material and labour costs.Grace Tao, Tesla's vice president in charge of external
communications in China, said on Weibo that the price cuts in
China reflected engineering innovation and answered Beijing's
call to encourage economic development and consumption.Deliveries of Tesla's China-made cars hit their lowest in
five months in December. Tesla's Shanghai plant, which was
expanded last year, also exports vehicles to Europe.So far, there has been no sign of Tesla cutting prices in
Europe, where sales jumped 93% in November year-on-year,
according to sales data from research group JATO Dynamics, and
the Model Y was the top-selling car for the second time in 2022.Tesla also saw its share of Europe's battery electric
vehicle (BEV) market jump to 18.9% in November, from 12.3% in
the same month a year earlier.SUBSIDIES ENDThe cuts came days after Beijing ended a subsidy programme,
with softening demand forcing Tesla and rivals to absorb the
brunt of the move.China Merchants Bank International (CMBI) said that Tesla
may have to do more, especially as competition with Chinese
rivals intensifies."Tesla needs to further cut prices and expand its sales
network in China's lower-tier cities amid ageing models," said
CMBI analyst Shi Ji."We expect new EV production capacity in China to outpace
new demand in 2023."But Sun Shaojun, a popular China auto blogger, said on Weibo
that Tesla's price cuts were so large that other automakers,
including larger rival BYD would have to respond.BYD recently raised the prices for its best-selling models
after the government's subsidies ended.After the price cut, Tesla's Model 3 was the equivalent of
about $1,000 more that BYD's Seal, a model launched in July. The
Model 3 is now the same price as BYD's best-selling Han EV.BYD declined to comment on competitors' pricing, but said it
would adjust its own according to changes in market demand.BYD, which sells both plug-in and pure electric vehicles,
saw its retail sales in China double in December, while Tesla's
fell 42%, according to data from CMBI.PROTESTS PLANNEDSome Tesla owners in China who took delivery in recent
months and did not qualify for the reduced prices said on Friday
that they planned protests at its showrooms in Shenzhen and
Henan, screenshots of social media chats seen by Reuters showed.Tesla had no additional comment. A Tesla spokesperson
referred Reuters to Tao's Weibo post.Tesla also cut Model 3 and Model Y prices by about 10% each
in Japan, the first time it had done so since 2021.In the United States, the Model Y and Model 3 are eligible
for up to $7,500 in clean vehicle tax credits as of this month
under the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act, which
became law in August.In 2021, China accounted for just over a third of Tesla's
overall sales.
