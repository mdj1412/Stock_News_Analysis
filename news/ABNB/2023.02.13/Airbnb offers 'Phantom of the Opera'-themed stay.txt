Location: Paris, FranceAirbnb is offering a night for two at the Palais Garnier the Parisian opera house that inspired the novel by French author Gaston Leroux'Box of Honor'(Emmanuel Marill, Airbnb's Director of EMEA)"This space is going to be the room for one night, for two people. It's a room that is right in front of the scene. It's a loge d'honneur (official box), which is probably one of the most iconic places with the loge of the Emperor (Napoleon III) -- which is just behind us -- of this beautiful theater."The stay includes a music recital, dinner in an ornate rehearsal room backstage and a behind-the-scenes tour of the elaborate 19th century buildingAirbnb says the Palais Garnier stay will be listed for 37 euros - the same number as the box(Veronique Dubrulle Leroux, Great granddaughter of Gaston Leroux)"It will be a beautiful homage for Gaston Leroux, this place and this idea, which, I say it again, is quite magical. It is a bit of a fantasy. I think it will be a bit unreal for people."
