The decision, first reported by Bloomberg News, affected less than 0.4% of the San Francisco-based company's total workforce of about 6,800, the spokesperson said."We've become a leaner and more focused company over the last three years," Airbnb spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the company expects to grow its headcount this year. The company said in February it expects headcount growth in the range of 2% to 4% in 2023, compared with 11% growth last year. In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Airbnb laid off 25% of its workforce, or nearly 1,900 employees, after its business was hit hard as global travel came to a standstill.
