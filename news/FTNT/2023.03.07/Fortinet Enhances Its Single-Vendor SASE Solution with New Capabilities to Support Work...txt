SUNNYVALE, Calif., March  07, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- John Maddison, EVP of Products and CMO, Fortinet “In today's work-from-anywhere world where users are on and off the network accessing distributed applications, Fortinet empowers organizations to consistently apply enterprise-grade security across all edges. New updates to FortiSASE enhance our ability to extend FortiGuard Security Services across the SD-WAN edge and cloud edge. Our commitment to continuously improving what is already one of the leading single-vendor SASE solutions on the market is why we’re seeing huge customer adoption and trust in Fortinet to support their SASE journey.”News Summary Fortinet® (NASDAQ: FTNT), the global cybersecurity leader driving the convergence of networking and security, today announced several enhancements to FortiSASE, Fortinet’s single-vendor SASE solution, to enable additional deployment flexibility and new secure access capabilities for digital resources across private applications, SaaS, and the internet. Single-Vendor SASE Secures Today’s Hybrid WorkforceToday, the majority of organizations—55% of respondents to a recent Fortinet work-from-anywhere survey—support hybrid workforces, which means most CIOs are tasked with the challenge of securing users as they move from home to office and during travel. When using solutions that aren’t integrated across on-premises and in the cloud, consistent security for all users is near impossible. And the larger and more distributed the network, the more pervasive these issues can be. Providing consistent security to a global hybrid workforce working both on-premises and off requires a single-vendor SASE approach.What’s new?Furthering Fortinet’s commitment to delivering a comprehensive SASE solution that extends the convergence of networking and security from the edge to remote users, Fortinet is announcing enhancements to FortiSASE, including:FortiGate Secure Edge Integration Enhancements: With the existing FortiGate Secure Edge integration, Fortinet Secure SD-WAN customers benefit from the flexibility to perform security on-premises (via FortiGate) or in the cloud (via FortiSASE). New enhancements to this FortiGate Secure Edge integration give teams even more granular control and flexibility to choose when to perform security on-premises or in the cloud to optimize user experience. This enhancement will particularly benefit organizations with a hybrid workforce and better ensure consistent security no matter where users are located.Secure Access Enhancements: Further enhancements have been made to all three key FortiSASE use cases to secure access for users to and from the internet, privately hosted applications, and SaaS applications.FortiSASE Enables Enterprise-Grade Security, EverywhereDesigned to provide consistent security for users anywhere, FortiSASE converges cloud-delivered security—including secure web gateway (SWG), universal zero-trust network access (ZTNA), next-generation dual-mode CASB, and Firewall-as-a-Service (FWaaS)—and networking (Secure SD-WAN).
