Intel said it lost momentum and market share to Advanced Micro Devices and other chip rivals but vowed to regain its footing.Wall Street was skeptical, however, as the stock fell more than 10% at the open, leading a decline in shares of chipmakers across the board.The challenge from AMD is playing out as tech spending slumps globally, complicating Intel's efforts to clear a record inventory glut.
