March 2 (Reuters) - Apple Inc has blocked an update
to email app BlueMail, which uses a customized version of
OpenAI's GPT-3 language model, the co-founder of the app
developer told Reuters on Thursday."Apple has blocked the BlueMail update and continues to
treat BlueMail unfairly and to discriminate against us," Blix's
Ben Volach said."Other GPT-powered apps seem not to be restricted," he
added.Apple, which rejected the app update last week, asked the
company to revise the app's age rating for those over 17 or
implement content filtering, as BlueMail may produce content not
appropriate for all audiences, according to a document viewed by
Reuters."We want fair­ness. If we're re­quired to be 17-plus, then
oth­ers should also have to," Volach tweeted, adding that many
other apps that advertise ChatGPT-like features listed on
Apple's app store do not have age restrictions.Apple, which was looking into the complaint, said developers
have the option to challenge a rejection through the App Review
Board process."It suggests to us that the company may scrutinize apps with
ChatGPT functionality in the same way it does others where there
are concerns about the quality of the user experience and
appropriate nature of the content or service provided by the
app," D.A. Davidson analyst Thomas Forte said.OpenAI's ChatGPT, which can generate content in response to
user prompts, has captivated the tech industry.Microsoft and Alphabet Inc's Google both
announced their own AI chatbots earlier in February.While AI-powered chatbots are a nascent field, early search
results and conversations have made headlines with their
unpredictability.
