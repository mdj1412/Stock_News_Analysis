"The more Powell talks, the more stocks and bonds go up". This comment, which graces the front page of Bloomberg's website this morning, is apt and sums up the mood of the moment. Yesterday, the U.S. central bank raised its key rate by 25 basis points, as expected. This comes after four hikes of 75 basis points and one of 50 basis points. The Fed Funds rate is now in the range of 4.50 to 4.75%. A year ago, it was close to zero (0.08% precisely in February). This is a measure of how far we have come in making money more expensive and, as was the plan, cooling inflation.

That's for the mathematical part. As for the narrative, investors expected to get a bit of a slap on the wrist from Fed boss Jerome Powell. After all, they had given in to their penchant for optimism by moving back into risky assets, despite calls for caution from economists and central bankers. Instead, they got a soft Powell - a nicer version than they had imagined. And by soft, I mean a central banker who didn't use the usual codes of caution and seemed to give in. There were still some warnings, but investors focused on two things. First, the Fed acknowledged that inflation was falling. Second, it didn't seem particularly concerned about the risk taking seen since January 1. And when Powell got a little tougher, the market didn't believe him. It doesn't think that there will be two more rate hikes in the current cycle. Nor does it believe that a rate cut is unthinkable by the end of the year.
As a result, Wall Street up sharply after the press conference. The Nasdaq recovered 2.16% at the end of the day. This is the fourth time in ten sessions that the U.S. technology index gains more than 2%. The S&P500 was up 1.05% at the close. Penalized by its oil and health stocks, the Dow Jones limited its gains to 0.02%. If we had to summarize the session, tech blinked in fluorescent green and energy in red.
Today, the focus turned to the Bank of England and the ECB. The former is facing an inflation of 9.2% with key rates at 3.5%. The latter is facing an inflation of 8.5% with rates at 2.50%. Experts expected a 50 basis point tightening for both institutions, and that's what happened.
The Bank of England raised interest rates for the 10th consecutive time but dropped its pledge to continue to increase them "forcefully" if needed and said inflation had probably peaked. It voted to increase the Bank Rate to 4.0%. The European Central Bank raise rates to 2.5%.
At the same time, corporate earnings releases continue. After several disappointments, Meta Platforms delivered figures that reassured investors last night. The former Facebook was up 20% in after-hours trading, which helped fuel the rebound in technology stocks. Several dozen large companies are scheduled to report today, up to the trio of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet tonight after the close of Wall Street. In premarket trading, futures were up 1.7% on the Nasdaq 100 and 0.7% on the S&P 500, while the Dow was flat.
