ALEXANDRIA, Virginia, March 10 (Reuters) - A U.S.
federal judge on Friday rejected a bid by Alphabet Inc's
Google to move a Justice Department lawsuit against it
over dominance in advertising technology from Virginia to New
York."I am going to rule against you," Judge Leonie Brinkema told
an attorney for Google.The government, which filed the ad tech lawsuit in January
along with eight states, accused the company of abusing its
dominance of the digital advertising business and argued that it
should be forced to sell its ad manager suite. Google’s online
advertising network, which includes ad manager, brought in 12%
of the company’s revenue in 2021.Google has denied any wrongdoing in running its ad tech
business. It declined to respond to a request for comment on
whether it planned to appeal the venue ruling, but said it would
"continue to set the record straight and show how we compete
fairly in a highly dynamic and crowded industry."The Virginia federal court has the reputation of being a
"rocket docket" that decides cases quickly. The New York judge
is hearing similar claims but from many plaintiffs, including a
case brought by the Texas attorney general in 2020. It is
expected to move more slowly.Eric Mahr, an attorney for Google, argued that there was a
risk the two courts would come up with conflicting judgments.Justice Department attorney Julia Wood said there would be
significant inefficiencies for the federal government if it were
required to join the larger case being heard in New York.Wood also said there were "meaningful differences" between
the Justice Department's case and many of the New York cases.
"We respectfully request the court retain jurisdiction," she
said in a hearing.The Justice Department's ad tech lawsuit follows a separate
lawsuit filed in 2020, the tail end of the Trump administration,
that accused Google of violating antitrust law to maintain its
dominance in search. That case goes to trial in September.The lawsuit comes as the Biden administration seeks to
toughen antitrust enforcement. Not only is it seeking to rein in
a tech giant with its Google suit, but it has a long list of
merger challenges.The search and advertising giant, which also makes a
smartphone operating system and owns YouTube, faces antitrust
lawsuits around the world with most based on abuse of dominance
of one sort or another.
