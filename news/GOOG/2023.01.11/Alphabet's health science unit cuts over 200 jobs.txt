Jan 11 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's health
science unit, Verily Life Sciences, said on Wednesday it had
laid off over 200 employees, or about 15% of its workforce,
marking the first time in at least six years when Alphabet or
its affiliate has announced job cuts.The move follows similar retrenchment exercises in corporate
America, concentrated among technology firms and banks, as
companies look to curtail spending in a tough economy."We will advance fewer initiatives with greater resources,"
Verily said in a blog post.It has stopped development on analytics tool Verily Value
Suite and some early-stage products, the company said, adding
that some employees will also be moved internally.Verily, which was born out of the Google X research program
in 2015, raised $1 billion from Alphabet in September last year.
At the time it had announced Stephen Gillett, a former
president, taking over as chief executive officer and co-founder
Andy Conrad becoming executive chairman of the company's board.Access, an Alphabet unit that houses Google Fiber, laid off
some employees in 2016.
