That was according to reports late Monday (January 2) by CNBC. Elon Musk's rocket firm, which counts Google-parent Alphabet among its investors, raised nearly $1.7 billion back in June. Backers in the new round reportedly include investor Andreessen Horowitz, which also put money into Musk's Twitter buyout deal. Spokespersons for SpaceX and Horowitz did not respond to requests for comment on the new reports. The rocket company has launched numerous cargo payloads and astronauts to the International Space Station. Its Starlink unit operates thousands of satellites providing internet services from orbit. It's looking to generate revenue from applications such as providing high-speed internet to airlines. SpaceX competes with private rivals including Amazon-founder Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin.
