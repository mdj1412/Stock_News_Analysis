(Alliance News) - Europe's major stock markets closed higher on Friday as fears of a recession in the U.S. grew in tandem with announcements of layoffs by big tech firms. The latest to break the news was Google, with Alphabet set to cut 12,000 jobs globally."Pre-earnings layoffs seem to be all the rage in the U.S. and have been welcomed by markets eager to see signs of cost cutting among companies. But it's a tough road ahead," commented Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG.
