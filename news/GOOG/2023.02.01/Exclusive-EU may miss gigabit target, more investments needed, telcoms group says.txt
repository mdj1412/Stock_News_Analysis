BRUSSELS (Reuters) -     The European Union risks missing its target to connectÂ all European households to a gigabit network by 2030, underscoring the need for more investments, according to a study commissioned by telecoms lobbying group ETNO.The study by Analysys Mason comes as the bloc considers the possibility of getting Alphabet Inc's Google, Meta, Amazon.com Inc, Netflix , Apple and Microsoft to bear some of the network costs.Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Telefonica, Telecom Italia and their peers say this should be seen as a fair share contribution from the six content providers which account for more than half of data internet traffic.
