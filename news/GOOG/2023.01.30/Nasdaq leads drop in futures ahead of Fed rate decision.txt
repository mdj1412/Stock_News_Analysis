The U.S. Federal Reserve is seen hiking the Fed funds rate by 25 basis points (bps) at the end of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, close on the heels of data showing signs of slowing demand and cooling inflation.   "The interest rate snowball is gathering speed, and its squashing down demand in its path," Susannah Streeter, markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown wrote in a client note. "Although rate rises are causing the U.S. economy to slip up, hopes have come in flurries that it will still have a soft landing. But there is nervousness ahead of the crucial Fed meeting this week."      This will likely be the smallest rate increase since the Fed kicked off its tightening cycle 10 months ago with a 25 bps hike, with financial markets pricing in a final rate hike in March. Money markets now see rates peaking at 4.9% in June, still below the 5% level expected by Fed policymakers.
