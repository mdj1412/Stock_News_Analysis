This transition allows us to add fuel-free generation for the benefit of our customers. At the same time, the $26 billion we plan to invest in our transmission and distribution systems over the next five years will help ensure the continued delivery of safe, reliable and affordable power to serve our communities,' Sloat said.We're strengthening our focus on these regulated investments and de-risking the business through active management of our portfolio, including the agreement that we announced yesterday to sell 1,365 megawatts of unregulated contracted renewables. We expect to close on that sale in the second quarter of 2023. We continue working closely with Liberty to complete the sale process of our Kentucky operations, filing a new FERC 203 application earlier this month and requesting expedited approval of the transaction. We also remain committed to completing the strategic review of our retail business in the first half of this year.We're seeing the tangible benefits of our long-term, strategic economic development program, despite global economic uncertainty and inflationary cost pressures. Two-thirds of our industrial load growth in 2022 was directly tied to our previous economic development efforts. Bringing new jobs and growth to our communities also helps maintain affordability as we make critical investments in the energy system,' Sloat said.EARNINGS GUIDANCEAEP management reaffirms its 2023 operating earnings guidance range of $5.19 to $5.39 per share. Operating earnings could differ from GAAP earnings for matters such as divestitures, impairments or changes in accounting principles. AEP management is not able to forecast if any of these items will occur or any amounts that may be reported for future periods. Therefore, AEP is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for earnings guidance.WEBCASTAEP's quarterly discussion with financial analysts and investors will be broadcast live over the internet at 9 a.m. Eastern today at http://www.aep.com/webcasts.

new legislation, litigation and government regulation, including changes to tax laws and regulations, oversight of nuclear generation, energy commodity trading and new or heightened requirements for reduced emissions of sulfur, nitrogen, mercury, carbon, soot or particulate matter and other substances that could impact the continued operation, cost recovery, and/or profitability of generation plants and related assets;
