In celebration of National Jefa Day on March 31, PepsiCo Juntos Crecemos is picking up the tab for the first 200 consumers who dine at select Latina-Owned businesses nationwide 
Applications for the PepsiCo Foundation's IMPACTO Hispanic Business Accelerator program will open summer of 2023
PURCHASE, N.Y., March 23, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- On the heels of Hollywood awards season, today PepsiCo launched year two of its signature Jefa-Owned (owned by a Latina boss) campaign to shine a spotlight on the stars of the food and beverage industry - Latina small business owners. In partnership with celebrity chef, restaurateur and author Lorena Garcia, and powered by PepsiCo Juntos Crecemos (Together We Grow), the Jefa-Owned campaign aims to provide access to business-building resources and national visibility for Latina-owned businesses.







The Jefa-Owned campaign kicked off today with an A-list-style brunch at Peruvian restaurant Qusqo Bistro and Gallery, a Latina-owned small business in Los Angeles. The invite-only brunch was hosted by Chef Lorena Garcia and featured an exclusive dining experience with a jefa-curated menu by the restaurant owner, Lucy Haro.
During the brunch, Chef Garcia, along with executives from PepsiCo Beverages North America and Frito-Lay, surprised Lucy Haro with an inaugural Jefa-Owned trophy as a testament to her work, dedication to overcoming systemic challenges and resilience leading her to establish one of the most popular Hispanic restaurants in the area.
"Latinos start one in four of all companies in America, and Latina-owned small businesses are the fastest-growing entrepreneurial segment," said Esperanza Teasdale, Vice President & General Manager, Hispanic Business Unit, PepsiCo Beverages North America. "This National Jefa Day, PepsiCo is proud to continue our support of Jefa-Owned small businesses - to shine a light on their entrepreneurial achievements and empower Latinas nationwide."

"Opening and sustaining a restaurant is challenging, and there are even more barriers for Latina-owned businesses in the food industry," said Chef Lorena Garcia. "As a restaurateur myself, I'm aware first-hand of the hard work, sacrifice and resilience that's needed to not only open, but successfully sustain a restaurant. Throughout my career, I've been committed to supporting other Latinas in the food and beverage space, and I'm honored to be an ambassador for this year's Jefa-Owned campaign to uplift Latina small business owners in communities across the country."
"Twice as many Latina-owned companies experienced closure during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to their male counterparts and, for many Latina small business owners, the compounding of external pressures such as cultural and gender roles has made them feel unseen and unheard, particularly in business," said Antonio Escalona, Senior Vice President & General Manager, Hispanic Business Unit, PepsiCo Foods North America. "We're excited to partner with Chef Lorena Garcia, a restaurateur herself, to shine a spotlight and encourage people to support Latina-owned small businesses as we continue our commitment to Hispanic-owned small businesses nationwide with the PepsiCo Juntos Crecemos program."
