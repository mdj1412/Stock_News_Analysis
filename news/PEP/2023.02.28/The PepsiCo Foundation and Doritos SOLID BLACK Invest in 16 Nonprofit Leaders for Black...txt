The PepsiCo Foundation and Doritos SOLID BLACK are committed to elevating Black leaders who are driving change within their communities.'Many Black community and non-profit leaders face roadblocks in gaining access to capital to start, sustain and/or scale up their work. In partnership with Doritos SOLID BLACK, the Black Nonprofit Changemakers program, seeks to narrow that gap and provide participants with the assets they need to not only survive but to adapt and thrive,' said C.D. Glin, President of the PepsiCo Foundation and Global Head of Philanthropy for PepsiCo. 'We believe lasting impact is led by those with lived experiences in local communities. These Black nonprofit leaders are proximate to the issues their organizations are striving to address and closest to the Black communities we're working to support more broadly.'This program supports leaders with philanthropic capital, personal and professional leadership development, fundraising capabilities, impact measurement, and network building. Additionally, the program offers an opportunity to amplify the nonprofits' mission to inspire and catalyze others to support their cause.'We're proud to continue our partnership with the PepsiCo Foundation to grow the SOLID BLACK initiative and take our support of Black Changemakers to another level,' said Stacy Taffet, senior vice president of marketing, Frito-Lay North America.
