Financial contributions and digital support will help local businesses prepare for increased customer traffic during Super Bowl LVII weekend; Applications for Juntos Crecemos Hispanic Digital & Delivery Program now open for food and beverage business owners nationwide
PURCHASE, N.Y., Feb. 2, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- As The Big Game draws near and an influx of visitors descend upon Phoenix, local businesses are anticipating a Super Bowl-sized boost to their bottom lines. To help them make the most of this important moment, PepsiCo Beverages North America and Frito-Lay, two units of PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have teamed up to give $50,000 and essential digital business-building resources to five Phoenix-based Hispanic-owned businesses to support operational enhancements in advance of the game. Today, Latino actor, producer and activist Wilmer Valderrama surprised two local small business owners, hand-delivering $10,000 checks, respectively. Powered by the PepsiCo Juntos Crecemos (Together We Grow) platform, these financial contributions reinforce PepsiCo's commitment to advance its Racial Equality Journey goal to invest in the long-term growth of Hispanic-owned restaurants, bodegas and carnicerías across the country.







Local business owners Alexis Carbajal and Juan Ayala, of the popular Puerto Rican restaurant Phoenix Coqui and MaryLou Sorkhabi, owner of the long-standing Mexican restaurant Rosita's Place, received the unexpected visit from Valderrama and PepsiCo executives to deliver the $10,000 checks and celebrate their continued business growth. Three other Phoenix businesses including Carnicería México, Imelda Happy Tamales, and Tacos Tijuana were also among the recipients of the $10,000 Juntos Crecemos checks. With the flood of football fans visiting Phoenix leading up to and during Super Bowl LVII weekend, owners can use the funds to stock up on additional supplies, hire and train extra staff, and offer extended hours, among other business enhancements to meet the increased customer demand.
In addition to the financial assistance, the five businesses also received free business-building services through the PepsiCo Juntos Crecemos Hispanic Digital & Delivery Program to strengthen their digital capabilities to access more online customers, an additional value of more than $12,000. The personalized business-building program offers one-on-one expert consultation for delivery logistics, technology, marketing and search engine optimization (SEO).
The monetary support and Juntos Crecemos Hispanic Digital & Delivery Program come at a time when there is a need for financial assistance and additional business resources for Hispanic entrepreneurs. According to a McKinsey and Company study conducted about the economic state of Latinos in the U.S., access to capital and better representation in growing sectors remain some of the main challenges, with 72% of Latino business owners relying on personal savings, family and friends for funding.
"For local Hispanic-owned small businesses, Super Bowl LVII will be a much-needed boost, especially for those still recovering from the impact of the pandemic," said Antonio Escalona, Senior Vice President & General Manager, Hispanic Business Unit, PepsiCo Foods North America. "The Juntos Crecemos contributions and Hispanic Digital & Delivery Program are ways in which PepsiCo Beverages North America and Frito-Lay are supporting these local businesses to help them make the most of this once in a lifetime moment," he added. "We're excited to partner with Wilmer Valderrama to shine a spotlight on these resilient entrepreneurs, and we encourage everyone headed to Phoenix for The Big Game to lend their support to the home team - local Hispanic-owned businesses."
"I am humbled to partner with PepsiCo Juntos Crecemos to help shine a light on the continued success of Phoenix's most beloved and longstanding Latino-owned businesses. For anyone visiting during the Super Bowl LVII, I encourage them to join me in supporting these small businesses to experience the authentic flavors of our culture that are ingrained in this city," said Valderrama. "When we support local businesses, we celebrate and elevate our communities."
