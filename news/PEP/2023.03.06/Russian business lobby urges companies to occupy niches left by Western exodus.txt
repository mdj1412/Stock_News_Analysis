chief on Monday called on companies from Russia and parts of the
former Soviet Union to occupy niches left by departing Western
firms, as Moscow seeks to forge deeper ties with so-called
friendly countries.Scores of foreign firms from McDonald's to Renault
have exited Russia or suspended their activities in the country
since Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine last
February.Western governments also imposed sweeping sanctions aimed at
strangling Russia's access to capital and certain goods. Moscow
considers those that have not imposed sanctions as "friendly"."We are not calling for sanctions circumvention, but using
the niches that have arisen in connection with the departure of
Western partners from Russia," said Alexander Shokhin, the head
of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs."Of course, not only Russian companies can occupy these
niches, but companies from the member countries of the EEU
(Eurasian Economic Union)."Some companies have pounced on their foreign rivals' exit,
such as drinks maker Chernogolovka, which said it was aiming for
a 50% share of Russia's near $9 billion soft drinks market after
Coca-Cola and PepsiCo halted production and sales
last year.Shokhin was speaking at his union's integration forum, where
other speakers named countries such as Egypt, Indonesia, Iran,
India and China as places where Russia has great potential to
increase trade.The EEU's other members - Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and
Kyrgyzstan - all sharply increased their exports to Russia in
2022, as European countries shunned Moscow and dramatically
scaled back shipments of goods.Russian aluminium tycoon Oleg Deripaska last week fretted
that Russia would run out of money next year without sufficient
foreign investment, urging the government to stop interfering in
business and lure investors back to the country's sanctions-hit
economy.President Vladimir Putin has also implored businessmen to
invest in Russia, scolding those who "beg" for money in the
West.
