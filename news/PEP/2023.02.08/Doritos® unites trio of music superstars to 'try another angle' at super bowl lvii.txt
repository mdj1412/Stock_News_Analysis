Music legend Elton John joins Jack Harlow and Missy Elliott in Super Bowl spot for new Doritos® Sweet & Tangy BBQ
Hawaii-based TikTok challenge winner also makes commercial debut in spot 
PLANO, Texas, Feb. 8, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Doritos is embracing the triangle – the shape and the underappreciated musical instrument – in its Super Bowl return, encouraging fans to TRY ANOTHER ANGLE. The TV commercial, released today, spotlights Harlow struggling to find originality for his next track. Drawing inspiration from the shape of his favorite snack – Doritos Sweet & Tangy BBQ – Jack transforms his music with the mesmerizing tune of a triangle instrument and effectively turns the music industry upside down. Joined in the spot by music icons Missy Elliott and Elton John, Harlow unleashes triangle mania.

 

"Doritos' mission to try another angle really resonates with me, whether it be pursuing a new artistic challenge like acting or working on a new sound with my own music," said Harlow. "Missy Elliott and Elton John are two people who have inspired me for years, so it was an honor to work with them on another timeless Super Bowl ad."
Bringing fans into the Super Bowl experience like never before, Doritos has selected Angie Yadao-Payad from Hawaii through its TikTok challenge, #DoritosTriangleTryout, to appear in the ad as well. With the help of TikTok sensation @vibin.with.tay, in just three days more than one million videos were submitted, making it Doritos' most successful TikTok activation to date.
"Doritos always has the most entertaining and fun Super Bowl commercials, so to become a part of this year's spot through Doritos' TikTok challenge is unreal!" said Yadao-Payad. "As a long-time Doritos fan, it makes me want to grab a bag and dig in because Doritos is my go-to snack for any party."
After dropping three teaser videos (found here, here and here) in recent weeks – which hinted at a Doritos-inspired collaboration among music legends – the brand has released its full commercial, "Jack's New Angle."
"Filming this year's Doritos Super Bowl commercial was so much fun," said Elton John. "Their commercials are always so creative, and I was of course honored to be chosen as the 'Triangle Player of the Year' – I hope Jack doesn't mind!"
TRY ANOTHER ANGLE on the Second Screen
Doritos will be the first brand to recreate its Super Bowl commercial in the Metaverse, offering fans the opportunity to produce and record their own triangle-inspired beats inside Decentraland at Doritos® Triangle Studios. Each fan can submit their beat for the chance to win one of Doritos' awesome prizes, including digital collectibles from CloneX and Meebits valued at over $20,000 total. Beat creators will also interact with "triangle mania" wearables, play mini games, "snack" on the new Doritos Sweet & Tangy BBQ and meet other fans.
Doritos is also taking Twitter to Another Level® with the #DoritosTriangleScheme – a pyramid scheme that actually pays off. Twitter users will need to scan or tap the image in a Doritos tweet on game day and generate their own unique QR code, then tweet it out with #DoritosTriangleScheme, #Entry and @Doritos to get their followers and friends to join. The more people a fan gets to join the movement, the greater the chance they have to win, including $25,000 for the grand prize winner.
"For more than two decades, Doritos has continuously delivered bigger and bolder Super Bowl commercials," said Brett O'Brien, chief marketing officer at Frito-Lay North America. "Music continues to play a central role in our campaigns, as Doritos teams up with the hottest musical artists to deliver something unexpected for fans. We've continued that legacy with a trio of iconic talent to inspire fans to break out of the norm and try another angle through this commercial and a first-of-its-kind digital experience."
