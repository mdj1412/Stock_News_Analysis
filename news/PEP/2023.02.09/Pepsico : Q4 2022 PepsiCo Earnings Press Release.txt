          PURCHASE, N.Y. - February 9, 2023 - PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2022.
        

          "We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and the full year as our business remained resilient and delivered another strong year of growth. Our results demonstrate that the investments we have made in our people, brands, portfolio, value chain, and go-to-market systems are working," said Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta.
        

          Laguarta continued, "Moving forward, we will continue to focus on driving growth and winning in the marketplace while developing advantaged capabilities to fortify our businesses for the long- term. This includes embedding pep+ at the center of our business in how we innovate, operate, run our teams, and build our brands.
        

          For 2023, we expect to deliver 6 percent organic revenue growth and 8 percent core constant currency earnings per share growth. We also announced a 10 percent increase in our annualized dividend, starting with our June 2023 payment which represents our 51st consecutive annual increase, and plan to repurchase approximately $1.0 billion worth of shares."

Excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes and the 53rd reporting week. In certain instances, the impact of organic volume growth on net revenue growth differs from the unit volume change due to the impacts of product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between bottler case sales (BCS) and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE). We report net revenue from our franchise-owned beverage businesses based on CSE. The volume sold by our nonconsolidated joint ventures has no direct impact on our net revenue.
          


          Note: Amounts may not sum due to rounding.
        

          Organic revenue and core constant currency results are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP information in the attached exhibits and to the Glossary for definitions of "Organic revenue growth," "Core" and "Constant currency."
        

          PepsiCo's fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December, resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years. PepsiCo's fourth quarter 2022 includes 17 weeks of results and its 2022 fiscal year includes 53 weeks of results.

          Discussion of Fourth-Quarter 2022 Reported Division Results:
        

          In addition to the reported net revenue performance as set out in the tables on pages 2 and A-9, reported operating results were driven by the following:
        

          Frito-Lay North America
        

          Operating profit increased 9%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including strategic initiatives, a 19- percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil, seasoning and potatoes, and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Additionally, impairment charges associated with a baked fruit convenient food brand reduced operating profit growth by 5 percentage points. The 53rd reporting week contributed 7 percentage points to operating profit growth.
        

          Quaker Foods North America
        

          Operating profit decreased 3%, primarily reflecting a 48-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, mainly grains and packaging materials, certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation costs, and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset by effective net pricing and productivity savings. The 53rd reporting week positively contributed 7 percentage points to operating profit performance. Higher restructuring and impairment charges negatively impacted operating profit performance by 3 percentage points.
        

          PepsiCo Beverages North America
        

          Operating profit increased 13%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing, higher income from joint ventures and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including incremental informational technology costs, a 53-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily fuel and resin, an organic volume decline and higher advertising and marketing expenses. The 53rd reporting week contributed 9 percentage points to operating profit growth. The lower net revenue due to the sale of Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands and higher restructuring and impairment charges reduced operating profit growth by 32 percentage points and 9 percentage points, respectively.
        

          Latin America
        

          Operating profit increased 5%, primarily reflecting net revenue growth, productivity savings, a 7- percentage-point favorable impact of adjusting certain non-income tax accruals in Mexico and a 3- percentage-point favorable impact of lower charges taken as a result of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 45- percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil, grains and packaging materials, higher advertising and marketing expenses and a 4-percentage-point unfavorable impact of certain indirect tax credits in Brazil in the prior year. Additionally, a favorable adjustment to the final purchase price associated with our sale of certain non-strategic brands contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit growth.
        

          Europe
        

          Operating profit decreased 420%, primarily reflecting a 400-percentage-point unfavorable impact of impairment charges related to the SodaStream brand (other impairment charges). Operating profit performance was also negatively impacted by a 141-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily packaging materials, cooking oil and potatoes, and certain operating cost increases. These impacts were partially offset by effective net pricing and productivity savings. Higher restructuring and impairment charges negatively impacted operating profit performance by 10 percentage points.
        

          Africa, Middle East and South Asia
        

          Operating profit decreased 148%, primarily reflecting a 105-percentage-point impact of impairment and other charges associated with our decision to sell or discontinue certain non-strategic brands and an investment (brand portfolio impairment charges) and a 21-percentage-point impact of impairment charges

          primarily related to certain juice brands from the Pioneer Food Group Ltd. (Pioneer Foods) acquisition (other impairment charges). Operating profit performance was also negatively impacted by a 167- percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily grains, cooking oil and packaging materials, certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses, partially offset by net revenue growth and productivity savings. Unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted operating profit performance by 15 percentage points.
        

          Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region
        

          Operating profit decreased 215%, primarily reflecting a 237-percentage-point impact of impairment charges related to the Be & Cheery brand (other impairment charges) and a 6-percentage-point impact of impairment charges on certain property, plant and equipment due to the discontinuation of a non-strategic brand (brand portfolio impairment charges) in China. Operating profit performance was also negatively impacted by a 96-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily potatoes and cooking oil, certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses, partially offset by net revenue growth and productivity savings. Unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted operating profit performance by 11 percentage points.

Excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes and the 53rd reporting week. In certain instances, the impact of organic volume growth on net revenue growth differs from the unit volume change due to the impacts of product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between BCS and CSE. We report net revenue from our franchise-owned beverage businesses based on CSE. The volume sold by our nonconsolidated joint ventures has no direct impact on our net revenue.
          


          Note: Amounts may not sum due to rounding.
        

          Organic revenue and core constant currency results are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP information in the attached exhibits and to the Glossary for definitions of "Organic revenue growth," "Core" and "Constant currency."
        

          PepsiCo's fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December, resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years. PepsiCo's 2022 fiscal year includes 53 weeks of results.
