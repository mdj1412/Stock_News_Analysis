Feb 27 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc is in early-stage
talks to acquire cancer drugmaker Seagen Inc in a
potential multi-billion dollar deal, the Wall Street Journal
reported, after advanced discussions between Merck and
Seagen fell through last year.The report on Sunday, which cited people familiar with the
matter, said the offer could be well over $30 billion but there
could be a number of hurdles, including the potential for a
stringent antitrust review of any proposal.Seagen had a market capitalization of roughly $30 billion,
as of Friday's close. Its shares have fallen nearly 10% since
July, when the deal talks with Merck were first reported. They
rose 13% to $182.55 on Monday.Pfizer declined to comment on the WSJ report, while Seagen
did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.The Merck-Seagen deal reportedly failed over concerns that
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) would launch an antitrust
investigation, but analysts said the Pfizer combination was not
raising any red flags."A Pfizer/Seagen combination will invite less scrutiny from
the FTC due to less overlap of their products when compared to a
Merck/Seagen deal," said Zhiqiang Shu, analyst at Berenberg
Capital Market.Shu said Seagen was poised to grow in the next decade and
has "a perfect profile for a takeout target," which could work
well for Pfizer that expects to lose $17 billion in annual sales
by 2030 due to patent expirations for top drugs, and as demand
for its COVID products begins to decline.Seagen, which specializes in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)
that bind to tumor cells and then release cell-killing
chemicals, made nearly $2 billion in revenue last year driven by
demand for its approved therapies such as lymphoma treatment
Adcetris and breast cancer drug Tukysa."After a year of waiting for something impactful, this may
be it," said Evan Seigerman, analyst at BMO Capital Markets,
referring to the potential deal, at a time analysts have pointed
to the need for larger acquisitions by Pfizer.Merck, which bought ADC-maker Imago BioSciences for
$1.35 billion in November, is unlikely to show renewed interest
in Seagen, analysts said. Merck was not immediately available
for comment."I'm sure there's always a possibility that there could be
other companies interested and there are other large pharma
companies that do need to transact. I'm thinking more of the
European pharma names," said Seigerman.(Reporting by Bhanvi Satija, Manas Mishra and Rahat Sandhu in
