Seagen Inc. (Nasdaq:SGEN) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2022. The Company also highlighted PADCEV® (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv), TUKYSA® (tucatinib), ADCETRIS® (brentuximab vedotin) and TIVDAK® (tisotumab vedotin-tftv) commercial and development accomplishments, as well as progress across its potentially transformative oncology pipeline.

“We delivered total revenue of nearly $2 billion in 2022, reflecting 25 percent growth compared to 2021 driven by strong demand for our portfolio of approved products,” said David Epstein, Chief Executive Officer of Seagen. “We made excellent progress in growing our four marketed brands. Importantly, the FDA is currently reviewing our supplemental regulatory submission under the accelerated approval program for PADCEV as first-line treatment for cisplatin-ineligible patients with advanced urothelial cancer, which has the potential to be a meaningful growth driver for the brand. We anticipate multiple key data and regulatory catalysts in 2023, which will provide a path for us to build a more global oncology leader with the potential to address the needs of still larger populations of cancer patients."

Cost of Sales: Cost of sales in the fourth quarter were $108 million, compared to $87 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Cost of sales were $410 million for the full year in 2022, compared to $312 million for the same period in 2021. The increases in 2022 were primarily driven by higher sales of our medicines and the related gross profit share amounts owed to collaboration partners, which were $64 million and $253 million in the fourth quarter and full year in total, respectively, compared to $46 million and $162 million for the same periods in 2021. Cost of sales also reflects amortization of TUKYSA acquired in-process technology costs, third-party royalties owed for PADCEV and TUKYSA net product sales, and cost of products sold.

Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses in the fourth quarter were $358 million, compared to $304 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. R&D expenses were $1.3 billion for the full year in 2022, compared to $1.2 billion in 2021. The increase in full year in 2022 primarily reflected continued investment in clinical development of the Company's approved drugs and pipeline programs.

Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses: SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter were $216 million, compared to $211 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. SG&A expenses were $821 million for the full year in 2022, compared to $716 million for the same period in 2021. The increases in 2022 were driven by ongoing commercialization efforts, legal costs, and other corporate activities.

Non-cash share-based compensation expense for the full year in 2022 was $221 million, compared to $173 million for the same period in 2021.

Net Income / Loss: Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $148 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $175 million, or $0.95 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year in 2022, net loss was $610 million, or $3.30 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $674 million, or $3.70 per diluted share, for the year in 2021. Net loss in full year 2021 included a $200 million upfront payment to RemeGen.
