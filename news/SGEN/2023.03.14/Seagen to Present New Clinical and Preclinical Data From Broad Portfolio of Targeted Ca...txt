Seagen Inc. (Nasdaq: SGEN) today announced the presentation of 17 abstracts featuring new clinical and preclinical data at the upcoming American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting taking place in Orlando from April 14-19, 2023. The broad range of data being presented at this year’s meeting includes research from Seagen’s approved medicines, as well as data from early-stage clinical, preclinical, and discovery research programs.

“Seagen’s robust presence at AACR this year, highlighting progress across our diverse pipeline, underscores our commitment to improving and extending the lives of people living with cancer,” said Roger Dansey, M.D., President of Research and Development and Chief Medical Officer at Seagen. “As a pioneer in antibody-drug conjugates, we strive to optimize and expand the potential of our core technology, while also progressing innovative, targeted cancer approaches.”

Highlights include an interim analysis from the innovaTV 207 Phase 2 study of tisotumab vedotin (TV) given every 2 weeks in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who have progressed after prior platinum combination, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy, if eligible. TV, which is being developed in partnership with Genmab, is a tissue factor (TF)-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). The innovaTV 207 study is currently ongoing and evaluating alternative dosing regimens of TV across multiple advanced solid tumors.

Other notable clinical data include initial results from a Phase 1 dose-escalation study of SEA-TGT monotherapy in patients with advanced malignancies. SEA-TGT is a novel investigational nonfucosylated human IgG1 antibody directed against TIGIT, an inhibitory immune checkpoint receptor that has emerged as a clinically relevant immuno-oncology target. SEA-TGT continues to be evaluated both as monotherapy and in combination with an anti-PD1 agent.

Seagen will also present new preclinical findings on the antitumor activity of disitamab vedotin, an ADC that targets cancers expressing HER2, as a monotherapy and in combination with tucatinib in breast and gastric cancer models, and on SGN-B6A, a wholly-owned, first-in-class vedotin ADC that targets integrin beta-6, which is highly expressed in a range of solid tumors.

Seagen and Sanofi will also unveil the first preclinical data from a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor ADC targeting CEACAM5, showing potent antitumor activity in patient-derived colorectal cancer models. These are the first data disclosed from the companies’ 2022 collaboration to develop and commercialize multiple novel ADCs.

Additional preclinical data disclosures are planned, highlighting vedotin programs and novel ADC and tumor targeting technologies, including payloads with immune stimulatory properties.
