SINGAPORE, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Chicago soybean futures
slid for a fourth consecutive session on Monday to their lowest
in more than one week, as expectations of rains in Argentina's
parched growing areas eased concerns over supplies.Corn fell to a one-week low, while wheat slid after closing
higher on Friday.FUNDAMENTALS* The most-active soybean contract on the Chicago Board of
Trade (CBOT) gave up 0.7% to $14.96-1/2 a bushel, as of 0135
GMT, after hitting its lowest since Jan. 12 at $14.96 a bushel
earlier in the session.* Corn fell 0.7% to $6.71-1/4 a bushel, the weakest
since Jan. 17 and wheat dropped 0.7% to $7.36 a bushel.* The spotlight is on South American crop weather given the
drought in Argentina, the world's largest supplier of soymeal
and soyoil.* A storm front should bring moderate to abundant rainfall
across most of Argentina's key agricultural area this week, the
Buenos Aires grains exchange said on Thursday, which could help
farmers plant their fields after a historic drought.* Brazil, meanwhile, is on track to produce a record soy
crop, which may hasten a seasonal shift in export demand away
from U.S. supplies.* Corn futures pared losses and traded higher at times after
the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported sales of U.S.
old-crop corn in the week to Jan. 12 at 1.1 million tonnes,
above a range of trade expectations and the biggest weekly tally
since mid-November.* Weekly sales of old-crop U.S. wheat also topped
expectations at 473,100 tonnes, lifting CBOT wheat futures.* Large speculators raised their net long position in CBOT
corn futures in the week to Jan. 17, regulatory data released on
Friday showed.* The Commodity Futures Trading Commission's weekly
commitments of traders report also showed that noncommercial
traders, a category that includes hedge funds, increased their
net short position in CBOT wheat and raised their net long
position in soybeans.MARKET NEWS* Global equity indexes rose sharply on Friday, with Wall
Street rallying after a jump in Netflix and Alphabet shares,
while the U.S. dollar had its biggest daily percentage gain
against the yen in about two weeks as the Bank of Japan governor
repeated the central bank will maintain its ultra-loose monetary
policy.DATA/EVENTS (GMT)
