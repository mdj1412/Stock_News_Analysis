The Bank of Japan holds a policy meeting, and investors think it might just have a move to announce. It's been the last holdout for ultra-easy monetary policy among major central banks. But data showing inflation picking up could mean it's time for a change. World leaders and assorted elites will gather again in the Swiss ski resort of Davos.  The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum is expected to draw record attendance. It will discuss everything from the cost-of-living crisis, to natural disasters and the conflict in Ukraine. Big earnings reports and U.S. retail sales data will gauge the health of corporate America. Goldman Sachs is among those to report, just as it starts a global jobs cull. Watch out too for numbers from Morgan Stanley, Procter & Gamble and Netflix.Figures from China are expected on industrial output, retail sales, economic growth and more. And the numbers are all expected to be ugly. Eyes will also be on travel ahead of China's new year celebrations - and what that tells us about the progress on reopening after lockdowns. And we'll get more clues to the global inflation squeeze. Data is due in the euro zone, UK, Canada and Japan. Core inflation in all four is mostly rising, and above target. There's little sign that consumers are about to get any relief.
