This January marks exactly six years since we launched our Polish language service, and  we've now created over 30 Polish films and TV series, including hits like High Water and How I Fell in Love with the Gangster. 


Today, we're excited to announce that we're also creating an engineering hub in Poland, based in our recently opened Warsaw office. Our engineers in Poland will help build the products that our internal and external creative partners use to deliver Netflix shows and films to members all around the world - hits like Wednesday, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mysteryand The Crown. 


Poland has amazing engineering talent given its excellent universities and strong developer community, and we can't wait to see the innovation and creativity that comes from our hub here. We are currently recruiting for business application software engineers - check out our current openings on Netflix Jobs.


See you in Warsaw!
