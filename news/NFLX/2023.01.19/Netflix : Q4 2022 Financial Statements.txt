              * The company believes that constant currency information is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average revenue per membership. In order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on average revenue per membership, the Company estimates the current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period.
