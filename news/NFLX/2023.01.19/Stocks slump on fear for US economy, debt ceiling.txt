(Alliance News) - Federal Reserve rate hike worries, poor data and US debt ceiling concerns provided the backdrop for a poor day for equities in Europe and a glum open in New York on Thursday. Wednesday's poor US retail sales reading soured hopes of a soft landing for the world's largest economy in the face of Federal Reserve rate hikes, while corporate earnings remain in focus in New York, with numbers from Netflix ahead. In Europe, European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde suggested more rate hikes are on the way, while in the UK, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey indicated rates are likely to peak at 4.5%.  The FTSE 100 index closed slumped 83.41 points, or 1.1%, at 7,747.29.

"European markets have taken their cues from last night's weak US finish opening and traded sharply lower as the early year optimism starts to run into a little bit of turbulence, and some profit taking," CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson commented. The mood in New York was no better, with the Dow having now surrendered all of its year-to-date gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.8% at the time of London's equity market close. It is now 0.3% lower this year. The S&P 500 was down 1.0% on Thursday, while the Nasdaq Composite returned 1.2%. US retail sales fell 1.1% month-on-month in December, figures on Wednesday showed, worse than market estimates of a lesser 0.8% decline. They had fallen 1.0% in November from October.Figures on Thursday, however, suggested the US labour market remains strong, despite a spate of job cuts in the technology sector, including plans announced on Wednesday by Microsoft Corp to cut 10,000 jobs.US initial claims for unemployment insurance in the US fell in the most recent week, according to the Department of Labor.In the week ending January 14, the advance figure for seasonally adjusted initial claims was 190,000.

IG analyst Joshua Mahony commented: "Today's improved US data does help ease some of the fears that we could be facing a sharp economic collapse this month."However, US markets appear to have led the drive lower, with the Tuesday declines on the other side of the pond feeding through into Europe yesterday and today."Despite the risk-off mood, the dollar failed to make robust gains.The pound was quoted at USD1.2363 at in London on Thursday, a touch lower from USD1.2366 at the equities close on Wednesday.
