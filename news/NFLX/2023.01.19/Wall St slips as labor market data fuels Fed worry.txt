lower on Thursday after data pointing to a tight labor market
renewed concerns the Federal Reserve will continue its
aggressive path of rate hikes that could lead the economy into a
recession.A report from the Labor Department showed weekly jobless
claims were lower than expected, indicating the labor market
remains solid despite the Fed's efforts to stifle demand for
workers.Expectations the central bank would further dial down the
size of its interest rate increases at its policy announcement
next month were unchanged by the report.Investors have been looking for signs of weakness in the
labor market as a key ingredient needed for the Fed to begin to
slow its policy tightening measures.Other data showed manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic
region was subdued again in January, while data from the
commerce department confirmed the recession in the housing
market persisted."What we are seeing is the market carving out a bottom in
the uncertainty so the news is having less of an effect and what
we are seeing today is really just a continuation of that," said
Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth
Financial Network, an independent broker-dealer in Waltham,
Massachusetts."The fact we are not seeing more of a reaction says a lot of
the bad news is out there."The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 252.4 points,
or 0.76%, to 33,044.56, the S&P 500 lost 30.01 points, or
0.76%, to 3,898.85 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped
104.74 points, or 0.96%, to 10,852.27.Recent comments from Fed officials continue to highlight the
disconnect between the central bank's view of its terminal rate
and market expectations.Boston Fed President Susan Collins echoed comments from
other policymakers to support the case for interest rates to
rise beyond 5%.But stocks moved off their session lows after Fed vice chair
Lael Brainard said the Fed is still "probing" for the level of
interest rates that will be necessary to control inflation.Markets, however, see the terminal rate at 4.89% by June and
have largely priced in a 25-basis point rate hike from the U.S.
central bank in February, with rate cuts in the back half of the
year..Both the S&P 500 and the Dow fell for a third straight
session, their longest streak of declines in a month.On the earnings front, Procter & Gamble Co declined
2.11% after warning of commodity costs pressuring profits,
despite raising its full-year sales forecast.Analysts now expect year-over-year earnings from S&P 500
companies to decline 2.8% for the fourth quarter, according to
Refinitiv data, compared with a 1.6% decline in the beginning of
the year.Netflix Inc closed 3.23% lower ahead of its results
scheduled for release after the closing bell on Thursday. But
the stock rebounded to gain 3.33% after posting subscriber gains
for the quarter and the departure of co-founder Reed Hastings as
chief executive to an executive chairman role.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a
1.49-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.70-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&P 500 posted 1 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the
Nasdaq Composite recorded 46 new highs and 33 new lows.(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak, editing by Deepa Babington)
