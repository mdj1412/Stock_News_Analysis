Major EU telecoms firms like Deutsche Telekom and Orange want content-providers like Meta and Netflix to contribute more.

AI systems like ChatGPT, and 5G technology are likely to drive conversation.John Hoffman is CEO of GSMA - a group that represents more than 750 mobile operators."Well, 5G is probably front and centre. I think we're going to probably have a lot of discussion about the road map. So where do we go post 5G? What does 5G really look like? And and how does it morph into big business, small business and consumers?"Attendees could hear a lot of debate, but they may also see new product launches.Huawei and Xiaomi are just two mobile giants expected to reveal their latest offerings.
