*Asian stock markets : https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4*BOJ under intense pressure as it defends yield policy*Yen hits 7-mth high, yuan climbs as dollar eases*Hopes for rapid China recovery aids most Asia stocks*More earnings ahead, many central bank speakers*SYDNEY, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Asian shares firmed on Monday
as optimism about China's reopening offset concerns the Bank of
Japan (BOJ) might temper its super-sized stimulus policy at a
pivotal meeting this week, while a holiday in U.S. markets made
for thin trading.The yen climbed to its highest since May after rumours
swirled the BOJ might hold an emergency meeting on Monday as it
struggles to defend its new yield ceiling in the face of massive
selling.That had local markets in an anxious mood, and Japan's
Nikkei slipped 1.3% to a two-week low.Yet MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside
Japan still added 0.9%, with hopes for a speedy
Chinese reopening giving it a gain of 4.2% last week.Chinese blue chips extended their rally with a
rise of 2.0%, while the yuan reached its highest since July.EUROSTOXX 50 futures added 0.6%, while FTSE futures
put on 0.1%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures
edged up 0.1%, after a Wall Street bounce last week.Earnings season gathers steam this week with Goldman Sachs,
Morgan Stanley and the first big tech name, Netflix, among those
reporting.World leaders, policy makers and top corporate chiefs will
be attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, and there are a
host of central bankers speaking, including no fewer than nine
members of the U.S. Federal Reserve.The BOJ's official two-day meeting ends Wednesday and
speculation is rife it will make changes to its yield curve
control (YCC) policy given the market has pushed 10-year yields
above its new ceiling of 0.5%.The BOJ bought almost 5 trillion yen ($39.12 billion) of
bonds on Friday in its largest daily operation on record, yet
yields still ended the session up at 0.51%.Early Monday, the bank offered to buy another 1.3 trillion
yen of JGBs, but the yield stuck at 0.51%."There is still some possibility that market pressure will
force the BOJ to further adjust or exit the YCC," JPMorgan
analysts said in a note. "We can't ignore this possibility, but
at this stage we do not consider it a main scenario.""Although domestic demand has started to recover and
inflation continues to rise, the economy is not heating up to
the extent that a sharp rise in interest rates and potential
risk of large yen appreciation can be tolerated," they added.
"Thus, we think the economic environment does not strongly
support consecutive policy changes."THE YEN UN-ANCHOREDThe BOJ's uber-easy policy has acted as a sort of anchor for
yields globally, while dragging down on the yen. Were it to
abandon the policy, it would put upward pressure on yields
across developed markets and most likely see the yen surge.The dollar is already at its lowest since May at 127.22 yen
, having shed 3.2% last week, and threatens to break
major support around 126.37.The euro also lost 1.5% on the yen last week, but was aided
by gains on a broadly softer dollar, which saw it reach a fresh
nine-month peak of $1.0872 on Monday.All of which saw the U.S. dollar index ease to its
lowest since June at 101.780.The dollar has been undermined by falling U.S. bond yields
as market wagers the Federal Reserve can be less aggressive in
raising rates given inflation has clearly turned the corner.Futures now imply almost no chance the Fed will raise rates
by half a point in February, with a quarter-point move seen as a
94% probability.Yields on 10-year Treasuries are down at 3.51%,
having fallen 6 basis points last week, close to its December
trough, and major chart target of 3.402%.Alan Ruskin, global head of G10 FX Strategy at Deutsche
Securities, said the loosening of global supply bottlenecks in
recent months was proving to be a disinflationary shock, which
increases the chance of a soft landing for the U.S. economy.
"The lower inflation itself encourages a soft landing through
real wage gains, by allowing the Fed to more readily pause and
encouraging a better behaved bond market, with favourable
spillovers to financial conditions," Ruskin said."A soft landing also reduces the tail risk of much higher
U.S. rates, and this reduced risk premia helps global risk
appetite," Ruskin added.The drop in yields and the dollar has benefited gold, which
jumped 2.9% last week and was trading at the highest since April
at $1,927 an ounce.Oil prices also rallied last week on hopes the speedy
reopening of China would boost demand. Data on mobility, traffic
and transport trips in China have shown a sharp revival in
movement ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays next week.Chinese data on economic growth, retail sales and industrial
output due this week are certain to be dismal, but markets will
likely look past that to a rapid recovery now coronavirus
restrictions have been dropped.Prices eased back a touch on Monday, with Brent off
45 cents at $84.83 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell 38
cents to $79.48.
