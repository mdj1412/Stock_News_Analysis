TOKYO, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average
slumped 1% on Monday, with exporters feeling the pressure from a
stronger yen as investors bet the Bank of Japan could be forced
to tweak stimulus settings again as soon as this week.The Nikkei lost 1.01% to 25,855.38 as of the midday
break, after earlier plunging through the psychological 26,000
line to as low as 25,748.10 for the first time since Jan. 6.The broader Topix shed 0.56% to 1,892.33.The yen reached its strongest since May at 127.215 per
dollar with speculators ramping up wagers that the
BOJ's yield curve controls are becoming untenable amid rising
inflationary pressure.The central bank sets policy on Wednesday, after shocking
markets last month by doubling the band that it lets the 10-year
Japanese government bond yield move around zero, to a range of
-0.5% to 0.5%.The benchmark yield exceeded that target for
a second day on Monday, reaching 0.51%."We tend to think that the market reactions have been a bit
excessive," said Yunosuke Ikeda, chief equity strategist at
Nomura."Buying of banks and selling of Nikkei 225 futures was based
on rapid normalization (of policy) by the BOJ, which is unlikely
to happen."Ikeda expects some reversal of recent moves after
Wednesday's BOJ decision, and forecasts the Nikkei to be at
26,500 by end-March.Bank stocks already saw investors taking money off the table
on Monday after last week's surge to a five-year high. Banking
was the worst performer among the Tokyo Stock
Exchange's 33 industry groups, dropping 2.05%.Automakers were weak, with Nissan sliding 1.74% and
Suzuki dropping 2.34%.Uniqlo store operator Fast Retailing tumbled 1.88%Nintendo, though, bounced 0.5%, but after dropping
to a nearly one-year trough at the start of the session.Chemical company Denka was Nikkei's biggest
decliner by far, plunging 15.89% after cutting earnings
forecasts.Notable winners included internet group CyberAgent,
rising 1.61% after subsidiary Babel Label entered a strategic
partnership with Netflix.Drugmaker Eisai added 1.57% after it announced it
had submitted a marketing authorisation application in Japan for
its Alzheimer's drug lecanemab.
