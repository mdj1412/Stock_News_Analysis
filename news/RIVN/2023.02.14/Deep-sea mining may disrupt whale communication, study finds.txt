JOHANNESBURG, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Noise produced by
mining the seabed for nickel, cobalt and other metals for the
green energy transition could interfere with whales' ability to
navigate the ocean depths and communicate with one another,
according to a study released on Tuesday.Potato-sized rocks filled with battery metals blanket vast
swathes of the ocean floor at depths of 4 to 6 kilometers (2.5
to 3.7 miles). Several companies have proposed to essentially
vacuum those nodules from the seabed and process their metals
for use in electric vehicle batteries.The peer-reviewed study, funded by Umweltstiftung
Greenpeace, a foundation arm of the environmental organisation,
argues that more research is needed to assess the risk deep-sea
mining could pose to large marine mammals, although researchers
did not collect field data themselves.The International Seabed Authority (ISA), a Jamaica-based
United Nations body, may approve deep-sea mining for
international waters as soon as this summer. Leaders in France,
Fiji, Canada and Germany have voiced concerns about the
practice.Supporters of deep-sea mining say it would lessen the need
for large mining operations on land, which are often unpopular
with host communities. Detractors say far more research is
needed to determine how deep sea mining could affect aquatic
ecosystems.The Metals Company Inc and others are pushing ahead
with plans to extract these nodules from the Clarion Clipperton
Zone, an ocean region in the northern Pacific where the ISA has
granted 17 seabed mining exploration licences. An estimated 22
to 30 cetacean species, including endangered blue whales, live
in the area, according to the study."The sounds produced from mining operations, including from
remotely operated vehicles on the sea floor, overlap with the
frequencies at which cetaceans communicate," said the study,
published in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science.Previous research on ocean noise has found whales can suffer
negative effects from deep-sea mining. One study found man-made
noise could increase the risk of humpback whale mothers being
separated from their calves because their normal vocalisations
are quiet.Vancouver-based The Metals Company said it is studying
acoustic data collected over three years with independent
researchers to determine "what the true impacts could be" on
whales."The Greenpeace paper is purely speculative, based upon zero
in-field data and funded by the industry's most vocal opponent,"
Dr. Michael Clark, environmental manager for The Metals Company,
said in a statement.Automakers Renault SA, BMW and Rivian
Automotive Inc oppose deep-sea mining.
