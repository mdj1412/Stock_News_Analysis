Feb 8 (Reuters) - The automotive industry is likely to
miss climate goals by 75%, according to a study backed by
electric vehicle makers Polestar and Rivian
that was released on Wednesday.
The study, the Pathway report, said the industry would
dramatically overshoot the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change's target to try to limit the average global temperature
increase to 1.5 Celsius by 2050 if automakers did not take
action."Electrification alone is not the solution â€“ even if every
car sold in the world tomorrow would be electric, we're still on
track to overshoot," Polestar and Rivian said, adding that they
had invited the world's leading car makers to a roundtable and
briefing discussion.The report suggests three "levers" to have a chance at
achieving the target by 2050: including a firm end date for
selling fossil-fuel cars and investing more in manufacturing
capabilities of electric cars; creating more green charging
options by investing in renewable energy supplies to global
grids; and focusing on more sustainable supply chains.Climate goals have been at the forefront of carmakers'
priority for the past decade as customers become increasingly
sustainability-conscious, with the recent energy crisis and war
in Ukraine underscoring the importance of accelerating the green
shift.Swedish automaker Volvo Cars is among those
that have pledged ambitious goals, promising that by 2030 it
will sell only electric cars. It also plans on reducing
emissions across its entire value chain, aiming to become a
climate-neutral company by 2040. Other carmakers have similar
goals.Despite the will of auto makers to make the shift,
geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions have continued to make
life difficult for the industry, with higher costs, component
shortages and supply chain issues continuing.Rivian is one of the companies that has struggled with
production ramp-up for its vehicles, and has been squeezed
further as EV giant Tesla cut its prices. In early
February, Rivian said it would lay off 6% of its workforce in an
effort to cut cost.Auto suppliers are also struggling with coping with the
additional costs for making their components sustainable in
order to meet carmakers' sustainability goals.
