        Forward-Looking Statements
      

        This presentation may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact (including statements containing the words "believes," "plans," "anticipates," "expects," estimates and similar expressions) should be considered to be forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may include statements regarding the expected benefits to Cisco, Acacia[1] and their respective customers from completing the acquisition, integration of Acacia's technology into Cisco's networking portfolio, accelerating the trend toward coherent technology and pluggable solutions, supporting Acacia's current merchant business, including Acacia's existing customers and new customers, and the expected completion of the acquisition. Statements regarding future events are based on the parties' current expectations and are necessarily subject to associated risks related to, among other things, the risk that the proposed acquisition may not be completed in a timely manner, or at all, which may adversely affect Acacia's business and the price of its common stock, obtaining Acacia's stockholder and regulatory approval of the acquisition or that other conditions to the closing of the transaction may not be satisfied, the effect of the announcement or pendency of the proposed acquisition on Acacia's business, operating results, and relationships with customers, suppliers, competitors and others, risks that the proposed acquisition may disrupt Acacia's current plans and business operations, risks related to the diverting of management's attention from Acacia's ongoing business operations, the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the definitive agreement, the outcome of any legal proceedings related to the transaction, general economic conditions, the retention of employees of Acacia and the ability of Cisco to successfully integrate Acacia's market opportunities, technology, personnel and operations and to achieve expected benefits. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. For information regarding other related risks, see the "Risk Factors" section of Cisco's most recent reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K filed on May 21, 2019 and September 6, 2018, respectively, as well as the "Risk Factors" section of Acacia's most recent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K filed with the SEC on May 2, 2019 and February 21, 2019, respectively. The parties undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason.
