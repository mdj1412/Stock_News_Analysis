In hands-on testing, PT found that moving to the Dell PowerEdge MX platform cut server migration times and reduced administrator steps compared to a new Cisco UCS X-Series platform.Durham, NC March 22, 2023 --(PR.com)-- When updating data center hardware with the latest technologies, organizations should consider the ease of the migration in addition to performance capabilities. Principled Technologies (PT) set up a cluster of legacy Cisco UCS servers and compared the ease of migrating the cluster onto a new Cisco UCS X-Series Modular System and a new Dell PowerEdge MX platform.

According to the report, “The modular Dell PowerEdge MX server platform offers an attractive migration target that can simplify the server migration process and save significant administrator time and effort compared to moving to a new Cisco UCS X-Series Modular System. By requiring 246 fewer administrator steps from initial configuration through server migration for a three-node cluster, choosing the Dell PowerEdge MX platform could help reduce human error and potential troubleshooting time as you move your new hardware into production.”
