TOKYO, Feb 22, 2023 - (JCN Newswire) -  - Cisco and NEC Corporation (TSE: 6701) today announced plans to expand their collaboration efforts to include system integration solutions and potential opportunities in 5G xHaul and private 5G to help customers transform their architecture and connect more people and things. End-to-End 5G xHaul AutomationCisco and NEC have expanded areas of collaboration under their Global Systems Integrator Agreement (GSIA) with augmented solutions for scalable 5G xHaul transport networks, such as enhanced capabilities for end-to-end automation and routed optical networking to support operators' monetization of 5G. Following the initial signing of the GSIA two years ago, the companies combined their respective strengths to expand geographical coverage of their solutions with stronger, faster connections for global operators such as Telefonica Vivo. With increasing traffic surges, demand for faster time to market with assured quality, and the need to innovate from transport to the edge, the companies have agreed to expand areas of collaboration including enhanced automation and routed optical networking. As part of the new collaboration, NEC will leverage its vast ecosystem and expertise as a global network integrator to overcome the complexity of multi-vendor networks. The company's 5G Transport Centers of Excellence in EMEA and LATAM, with both local and regional engineering capabilities and a pool of global experience, will play a central role in navigating customers' end-to-end network lifecycle and optimization in a phased approach. With extensive experience, leadership, and knowledge of the industry, combined with a commitment to research and development, Cisco will provide industry-leading solutions that meet growing customer demands.
