)HANOI, March 17 (Reuters) - Vietnamese electric-vehicle
(EV) start-up VinFast said on Friday three senior sales and
customer-service have left the company this week.The departures are the latest in a string of executive
changes for the ambitious Vietnamese automaker. They also come
after a delayed and costly rollout of VinFastâ€™s first EVs in
California, its debut overseas market.In a statement to Reuters, VinFast said Gareth Dunsmore,
deputy chief executive for global sales and marketing, had left
"due to personal reasons and we respect his decision".VinFast said two other U.S.-based executives had left
because of "changes in the management model and specific
business requirements": Greg Tebbutt, who had been chief
marketing officer, and Craig Westbrook, former chief service
officer.Dunsmore, Tebbutt and Westbrook could not be immediately
reached for comment.The company, a subsidiary of conglomerate Vingroup JSC
, dispatched a shipment of 999 of its VF8 SUVs to
California from Vietnam in November, but needed until earlier
this month to prepare them for delivery to customers after
disclosing the car would have lower battery range than it had
flagged to buyers.VinFast has been selling the first batch of VF8s, rebranded
as the City Edition to account for the lower range, on lease in
California. It expects to ship a longer-range version of the VF8
later this year.The company is looking to break into the U.S. EV market
at a time when established competitors, led by Tesla,
are driving down prices and preparing to roll out a range of new
models.Rival EV startups, including Lucid, Rivian
and electric truck maker Nikola, have faced
pressure from lower orders, higher interest rates and increased
competition.In February, VinFast consolidated operations in the U.S. and
Canada, cutting some 80 jobs, including former U.S. Chief
Financial Officer Rodney Haynes.In June, VinFast said it had ended its contract with
Emmanuel Bret, the predecessor as deputy CEO for global sales to
just-departed Dunsmore. Three other senior executives also left
at that time.Huy Chieu, a former General Motors engineer who was
promoted in June to lead EV product development, resigned in
December before the company's first cars were delivered to U.S.
customers.VinFast has also had three CEOs since its founding in 2017.The company, which began production in 2019, is planning to
build a factory in North Carolina and has filed to list its
shares through an initial public offering (IPO) in the United
States.VinFast lost $2.1 billion in 2022 on revenue of $634
million, it said in a registration statement for an IPO.
