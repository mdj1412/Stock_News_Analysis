(NASDAQ: LCID), setting new standards with the longest-range, fastest-charging electric car on the market, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2022. The Company produced 3,493 vehicles during Q4 at its manufacturing facility in Arizona and delivered 1,932 vehicles during the same period. On a full-year basis, the Company produced 7,180 vehicles, exceeding the 2022 annual production guidance of 6,000 to 7,000 vehicles, and delivered 4,369 vehicles in 2022. Lucid today also announced its 2023 annual production guidance of 10,000 to 14,000 vehicles. 







Lucid reported fourth quarter revenue of $257.7 million and annual revenue of $608.2 million, ending the quarter with approximately $4.9 billion total liquidity, which is expected to fund the Company at least into the first quarter of 2024. The Company reported reservations of over 28,000, as of February 21, 2023, representing potential sales of over $2.7 billion. This reservation number does not include the up to 100,000 vehicles under the agreement with the government of Saudi Arabia. 
"Last year was a challenging year for everyone, yet despite the extraordinary supply chain and logistics challenges, the team persevered with an unrelenting focus on delivering what we believe is the best luxury sedan on the market," said Peter Rawlinson, Lucid's CEO and CTO.
"Lucid Air has it all — industry-leading range, exceptional driving dynamics, and superior performance all wrapped up in a truly elegant design with a spacious interior cabin. But more importantly, the technological advances of Lucid Air are developed entirely in-house with the singular goal to advance the adoption of EVs around the world for future generations to come. Lucid Air is the quintessential luxury sedan, and our goal in 2023 is to amplify our sales and marketing efforts to get this amazing product into the hands of even more customers around the world," Rawlinson added.
"In 2022, we scaled every part of our business while keeping a sharp focus on execution. In our first full year of production, we manufactured 7,180 vehicles and delivered 4,369 vehicles, generating revenue of just over $608 million," said Sherry House, Lucid's CFO. "As we look ahead to 2023, we'll continue to focus on strong capital discipline, leaving no stone unturned for every cost optimization. We are proud of our technology and product achievements. We're gearing for growth, while simultaneously taking a comprehensive look at reducing costs, and I'm very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead of us."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Business Metrics
Consolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with US GAAP ("GAAP") as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Lucid's non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow which are discussed below.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss before (1) interest expense, (2) interest income, (3) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (4) depreciation and amortization, (5) change in fair value of forward contracts, (6) change in fair value of convertible preferred stock warrant liability, (7) change in fair value of common stock warrant liability, (8) transaction costs expensed and (9) stock-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that Lucid believes provides useful information to Lucid's management and investors about Lucid's profitability. Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow is a performance measure that Lucid believes provides useful information to Lucid's management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures.
These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to Lucid's historical performance. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting, and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to Lucid's investors regarding measures of our financial condition and results of operations that Lucid uses to run the business and therefore allows investors to better understand Lucid's performance. However, these non-GAAP financial and key performance measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.
Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under GAAP when understanding Lucid's operating performance. In addition, other companies, including companies in Lucid's industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of Lucid's non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures as tools for comparison. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is presented below.

___________________________________
1 The business combination (the "Merger") between Lucid Group Inc.'s predecessor, Atieva, Inc. ("Legacy Lucid"), and Churchill Capital Corp IV ("CCIV"), which closed on July 23, 2021, is accounted for as a reverse recapitalization under U.S. GAAP. Under this method of accounting, CCIV has been treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the financial statements of Lucid represent a continuation of the financial statements of Legacy Lucid with the Merger being treated as the equivalent of Legacy Lucid issuing shares for the net assets of CCIV, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of CCIV were recognized as of the closing of the Merger at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Operations prior to the Merger are presented as those of Legacy Lucid and the accumulated deficit of Legacy Lucid has been carried forward after the closing of the Merger. All periods prior to the Merger have been retrospectively adjusted using the applicable exchange ratio for the equivalent number of shares outstanding immediately after the closing of the Merger to effect the reverse recapitalization. See our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 for additional information.
