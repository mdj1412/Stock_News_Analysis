Financial outlook and guidanceThe non-GAAP financial guidance discussed below reflects certain pro forma adjustments to assist in analyzing and assessing our core operational performance, including our Core Illumina and GRAIL segments. Please see our Reconciliation of Consolidated Non-GAAP Financial Guidance included in this release for a reconciliation of these GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
For fiscal year 2023, the company expects consolidated revenue growth of 7% to 10% compared to fiscal year 2022. We expect GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.03 to $0.28 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.25 to $1.50. The GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance ranges assume that the existing R&D capitalization requirements are not repealed in fiscal year 2023 and, as a result, reflect an impact of approximately $75 million.
The company expects Core Illumina revenue growth of 6% to 9% compared to fiscal year 2022. GRAIL revenue is expected to be in the range of $90 million to $110 million.

Statement regarding use of non-GAAP financial measuresThe company reports non-GAAP results for diluted earnings per share, net income, gross margin, operating expenses, including research and development expense, selling general and administrative expense, legal contingencies and settlement, and goodwill impairment, operating income (loss), operating margin, gross profit (loss), other income (expense), tax provision, constant currency revenue growth, and free cash flow (on a consolidated and, as applicable, segment basis for our Core Illumina and GRAIL segments) in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The company's financial measures under GAAP include substantial charges such as amortization of acquired intangible assets among others that are listed in the itemized reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release, as well as the effects of currency translation. Management has excluded the effects of these items in non-GAAP measures to assist investors in analyzing and assessing past and future operating performance, including in the non-GAAP measures related to our Core Illumina and GRAIL segments. Additionally, non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are key components of the financial metrics utilized by the company's board of directors to measure, in part, management's performance and determine significant elements of management's compensation.
The company encourages investors to carefully consider its results under GAAP, as well as its supplemental non-GAAP information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand its business. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in the tables of this release.
Use of forward-looking statementsThis release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Among the important factors to which our business is subject that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements are: (i) changes in the rate of growth in the markets we serve; (ii) the volume, timing and mix of customer orders among our products and services; (iii) our ability to adjust our operating expenses to align with our revenue expectations; (iv) our ability to manufacture robust instrumentation and consumables; (v) the success of products and services competitive with our own; (vi) challenges inherent in developing, manufacturing, and launching new products and services, including expanding or modifying manufacturing operations and reliance on third-party suppliers for critical components; (vii) the impact of recently launched or pre-announced products and services on existing products and services; (viii) our ability to further develop and commercialize our instruments, consumables, and products, including Galleri, the cancer screening test developed by GRAIL, to deploy new products, services, and applications, and to expand the markets for our technology platforms; (ix) the risks and costs associated with our ongoing inability to integrate GRAIL due to the interim measures imposed on us by the European Commission as a result of their prohibition of our acquisition of GRAIL; (x) the risks and costs associated with the integration of GRAIL's business if we are ultimately able to integrate GRAIL; (xi) the risk that disruptions from the consummation of our acquisition of GRAIL and associated legal or regulatory proceedings, including related appeals, or obligations will harm our business, including current plans and operations; (xii) the risk of incurring fines associated with the consummation of our acquisition of GRAIL and the possibility that we may be required to divest all or a portion of the assets or equity interests of GRAIL on terms that could be materially worse than the terms on which we acquired GRAIL; (xiii) our ability to obtain approval by third-party payors to reimburse patients for our products; (xiv) our ability to obtain regulatory clearance for our products from government agencies; (xv) our ability to successfully partner with other companies and organizations to develop new products, expand markets, and grow our business; (xvi) uncertainty, or adverse economic and business conditions, including as a result of slowing or uncertain economic growth, COVID-19 pandemic mitigation measures, or armed conflict; (xvii) the application of generally accepted accounting principles, which are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments and (xviii) legislative, regulatory and economic developments, together with other factors detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, or in information disclosed in public conference calls, the date and time of which are released beforehand.

(a) Free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment. Free cash flow is useful to management as it is one of the metrics used to evaluate our performance and to compare us with other companies in our industry. However, our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.

All amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest millions, except as otherwise noted. As a result, certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided.
(a) Non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share exclude the effects of the pro forma adjustments as detailed above. Non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are key components of the financial metrics utilized by the company's board of directors to measure, in part, management's performance and determine significant elements of management's compensation. Management has excluded the effects of these items in these measures to assist investors in analyzing and assessing our past and future operating performance.
(b) Refer to our Itemized Reconciliations between GAAP and Non-GAAP Results of Operations below for the components of these amounts.
(c) Amounts represent the impact of GRAIL pre-acquisition net operating losses on GILTI and the utilization of U.S. foreign tax credits.
(d) Incremental non-GAAP tax expense reflects the tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments listed.
(e) Amounts represent the difference between book and tax accounting related to stock-based compensation cost.
(f) In loss periods, GAAP basic loss per share and diluted loss per share are identical since the effect of potentially dilutive shares is anti-dilutive and therefore excluded. For non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, the impact of potentially dilutive shares from our convertible senior notes and equity awards is included and is calculated based on the sum of weighted-average common shares and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during 2022.
(g) Amounts represent interest expense on our 2023 Convertible Senior Notes, net of any income tax effects, which is added back to the numerator used to calculate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, for purposes of the if-converted method, upon the adoption of ASU 2020-06, as it would have a dilutive effect on the calculation of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share.

(a) Non-GAAP gross profit, included within non-GAAP operating profit (loss), is a key measure of the effectiveness and efficiency of manufacturing processes, product mix and the average selling prices of our products and services. Non-GAAP operating profit (loss) and non-GAAP other income (expense), net exclude the effects of the pro forma adjustments as detailed above. Management has excluded the effects of these items in these measures to assist investors in analyzing and assessing past and future operating performance, including in the non-GAAP measures related to our Core Illumina and GRAIL segments.
(b) Reconciling amounts are recorded in cost of revenue.
(c) Amount consists of direct and incremental expenses incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily expenses related to employee testing and incremental cleaning in 2021. Such expenses were not excluded in 2022.
(d) Amount for Q4 2022 consists of a legal accrual related to our litigation with RavGen, and an adjustment made to our previously recorded legal accrual for the potential fine that the European Commission may impose on us of up to 10% of our consolidated annual revenues, in order to reflect 10% of consolidated annual revenues for fiscal year 2022 rather than 2021. For 2022, the total amount accrued related to this potential fine is $458 million. Amount for 2022 also consists of expense of $145 million related to the settlement of our litigation with BGI.
(e) Amounts consist primarily of fair value adjustments for our contingent consideration liability related to the GRAIL acquisition.
(f) Amounts consist primarily of legal expenses related to our acquisitions. Amounts for Q4 2021 consist primarily of a gain of $86 million recorded as a result of exchanging certain contingent value rights issued as part of the GRAIL acquisition and other acquisition-related expenses. Amounts for 2021 consist primarily of a gain of approximately $899 million related to the fair value adjustment of our previously held interest in GRAIL, approximately $654 million in day one compensation expense related to the GRAIL acquisition, Continuation Payments made to GRAIL totaling $245 million and other acquisition-related expenses.
(g) Amount consists of direct and incremental income due to the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily payroll-related credits earned in the U.S. and Canada in 2021. Such income was not excluded in 2022.
(h) Amount consists of a gain related to a patent litigation settlement.
(i) Amounts consist primarily of mark-to-market adjustments and impairments from our strategic investments.
(j) Amounts consist of fair value adjustments related to our Helix contingent value right.
(k) Non-cash interest expense is calculated in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash.

The adoption eliminated the non-cash interest expense related to the conversion feature of our 2023 Convertible Senior Notes beginning in Q1 2022.
(l) Amount represents a gain recorded on our derivative assets in 2021 related to the terminated acquisition with Pacific Biosciences as a result of Pacific Biosciences repaying to us $52 million in Continuation Advances.
(m) Amount consists of expenses related to the bridge facility commitment, which was terminated in 2021 in conjunction with our issuance of term notes.
(n) Amount consists of loss on extinguishment of our 2021 Convertible Senior Notes, which matured in 2021.
