      •The Company placed 369 da VinciSurgical Systems, a decrease of 4% compared with 385 in the fourth quarter of 2021.
    

      •The Company grew its da Vinci Surgical System installed base to 7,544 systems as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 12% compared with 6,730 as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2021.

      Q4 Financial Summary
    

      Gross profit, income from operations, net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc., and net income per diluted share attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. are reported on a GAAP and non-GAAP* basis. Additionally, constant currency revenue growth is reported on a non-GAAP* basis. The non-GAAP* measures are described below and are reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures at the end of this release.
    

      Fourth quarter 2022 revenue was $1.66 billion, an increase of 7% compared with $1.55 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. The higher fourth quarter revenue was driven by growth in da Vinci procedure volume, partially offset by a decline in system placements and foreign currency impacts. On a constant currency basis, fourth quarter 2022 revenue increased 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.
    

      Fourth quarter 2022 instruments and accessories revenue increased by 12% to $941 million, compared with $843 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. The increase in instruments and accessories revenue was primarily driven by approximately 18% growth in da Vinci procedure volume, partially offset by customer buying patterns and foreign currency impacts.
    

      Fourth quarter 2022 systems revenue decreased by 4% to $451 million, compared with $470 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Company placed 369 da Vinci Surgical Systems in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared with 385 systems in the fourth quarter of 2021. The fourth quarter 2022 system placements included 154 systems placed under operating lease and usage-based arrangements, compared with 143 systems in the fourth quarter of 2021.
    

      Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP income from operations decreased to $373 million, compared with $450 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP income from operations included share-based compensation expense of $129 million, compared with $120 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP income from operations also included litigation charges of $21 million. Fourth quarter 2022 non-GAAP* income from operations decreased to $530 million, compared with $583 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.
    

      Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. was $325 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, compared with $381 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2021. Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. included excess tax benefits of $18 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared with $27 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2021.

      The Company ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with $6.74 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, a decrease of $651 million during the quarter, primarily driven by share repurchases of $1 billion and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash generated from operations.
    

      Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
    

      During 2022, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business has differed by geography and region.

During the second half of 2022, the Company saw COVID-19 resurgences impact da Vinci procedure volumes in China.

      *About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
    

      To supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: constant currency revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc., non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. ("EPS"), and non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.
    

      The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance by excluding items such as amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation ("SBC") and long-term incentive plan expenses, and other special items. Long-term incentive plan expense relates to phantom share awards granted in China by the Company's Intuitive-Fosun joint venture to its employees that vest over four years and can remain outstanding for seven to ten years. These awards are valued based on certain key performance metrics. Accordingly, they are subject to significant volatility based on the performance of these metrics and are not tied to performance of the Company's business within the period. The Company presents constant currency revenue to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to its historical performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors, because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (2) they are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance of the Company's business.
    

      Constant currency revenue growth. The Company calculates constant currency revenue by translating current period revenue using prior period exchange rates. The constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the increase in the current period constant currency revenue over the prior period revenue. Fourth quarter 2022 as reported revenue increased 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Foreign currency fluctuations had a 3% unfavorable impact on fourth quarter 2022 revenue. Fourth quarter 2022 constant currency revenue increased 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.
    

      Non-GAAP gross profit. The Company defines non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit, excluding amortization of intangible assets and SBC and long-term incentive plan expenses.
    

      Non-GAAP income from operations. The Company defines non-GAAP income from operations as income from operations, excluding amortization of intangible assets, SBC and long-term incentive plan expenses, litigation charges and recoveries, and a gain on the sale of a business.
    

      Non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and EPS. The Company defines non-GAAP net income as net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc., excluding amortization of intangible assets, SBC and long-term incentive plan expenses, litigation charges and recoveries, a gain on the sale of a business, gains (losses) on strategic investments, adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interest in joint venture, net of the related tax effects, and tax adjustments, including the excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with SBC arrangements and the net tax effects related to intra-entity transfers of non-inventory assets. The Company excludes the excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with SBC arrangements as well as the tax effects associated with non-cash amortization of deferred tax assets related to intra-entity non-inventory transfers, because the Company does not believe these items correlate with the on-going results of its core operations. The tax effects of the non-GAAP items are determined by applying a calculated non-GAAP effective tax rate, which is commonly referred to as the with-and-without method. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that these non-GAAP adjustments had on the Company's operating results. The Company's calculated non-GAAP effective tax rate is generally higher than its GAAP effective tax rate. The Company defines non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. divided by non-GAAP diluted shares, which are calculated as GAAP weighted-average outstanding shares plus dilutive potential shares outstanding during the period.
    

      There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP measures versus measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc., and non-GAAP EPS exclude items such as amortization of intangible assets, SBC and long-term incentive plan expenses, excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with SBC arrangements,
    

      Page 4 of 9
    




      and non-cash amortization of deferred tax assets related to intra-entity transfer of non-inventory assets, which are primarily recurring items. SBC expense has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in the Company's business. In addition, the components of the costs that the Company excludes in its calculation of non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and non-GAAP EPS may differ from the components that its peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management addresses these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and non-GAAP EPS together with net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and net income per share attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. calculated in accordance with GAAP.

              (1) Beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2022, the Company is no longer adjusting non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc., or non-GAAP net income per share attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. for charges relating to intellectual property and license arrangements expensed to R&D. The Company made these changes to its presentation of non-GAAP financial measures based on its understanding of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (the "SEC") current views on this practice from knowledge of communications between the SEC and a number of pharmaceutical and life sciences companies and independent registered public accounting firms. Historical non-GAAP measures presented in our earnings release have been adjusted for comparability. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the impact of this adjustment was a decrease of non-GAAP income from operations of $7.7 million and $17.6 million, respectively, or $0.02 and $0.04 to the diluted net income per share attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc., net of tax. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the impact was a decrease of non-GAAP income from operations of $5.0 million and $8.4 million, respectively, or $0.01 and $0.02 to the diluted net income per share attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc., net of tax.
            





              (2) For the three months ended December 31, 2022, tax adjustments included: (a) excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation arrangements of $(18.3) million, or $(0.05) per diluted share; (b) tax impact related to intra-entity transfers of non-inventory assets of $6.9 million, or $0.02 per diluted share; and (c) other tax adjustments effects determined by applying a calculated non-GAAP effective tax rate of $(31.0) million, or $(0.09) per diluted share. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, tax adjustments included: (a) excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation arrangements of $(98.7) million, or $(0.27) per diluted share; (b) tax impact related to intra-entity transfers of non-inventory assets of $27.9 million, or $0.08 per diluted share; and (c) other tax adjustments effects determined by applying a calculated non-GAAP effective tax rate of $(146.3) million, or $(0.40) per diluted share.
