      Preliminary Results
    

      The Company expects fourth quarter 2022 revenue of approximately $1.66 billion, an increase of 7% compared with $1.55 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Company expects 2022 revenue of approximately $6.22 billion, an increase of 9% compared with $5.71 billion in 2021. The unaudited results in this press release are preliminary and subject to the completion of the Company's final closing procedures and annual independent audit and, therefore, are subject to adjustment.
    

      Preliminary fourth quarter 2022 instruments and accessories revenue increased by 12% to approximately $941 million, compared with $843 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily driven by growth in da Vinci procedure volume, partially offset by customer buying patterns and foreign currency impacts. Preliminary full year 2022 instruments and accessories revenue increased by 13% to approximately $3.52 billion, compared with $3.10 billion for 2021, primarily driven by growth in da Vinci procedure volume, partially offset by foreign currency impacts and customer buying patterns in 2022 and the benefit of stocking orders in 2021 associated with the launch of the Company's Extended Use Program.
    

      Fourth quarter 2022 da Vinci procedures increased approximately 18% compared with the fourth quarter of 2021. In 2022, approximately 1,875,000 surgical procedures were performed with da Vinci Surgical Systems, an increase of approximately 18% compared with approximately 1,594,000 surgical procedures performed with da Vinci Surgical Systems in 2021. The growth in the Company's overall procedure volume in 2022 was primarily driven by growth in U.S. general surgery procedures and outside of the U.S. cancer procedures. The Company expects worldwide da Vinci procedures to increase approximately 12% to 16% in 2023.

      Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
    

      During 2022, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business has differed by geography and region. During the first half of 2022, the Company saw COVID-19 resurgences impact da Vinci procedure volumes in the U.S. and Europe followed by recoveries. During the second half of 2022, the Company saw COVID-19 resurgences impact da Vinci procedure volumes in China. COVID-19 has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on the Company's procedure volumes.
    

      Commenting on the announcement, Intuitive CEO Gary Guthart said, "Our customers continued to grow their adoption of our training, products, and services in the fourth quarter and for the full year. We remain focused on supporting our customers' drive to improve the quadruple aim in acute interventions."
