Dexcom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), a global leader in real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for people with diabetes, announced today the launch of its Dexcom G6 CGM System in Singapore for people with diabetes ages two years and older, including pregnant women, and the appointment of DKSH Singapore Pte Ltd as sales, marketing, and distribution service provider.

The Dexcom G6 uses a small, wearable sensor and transmitter to continuously measure and send glucose levels wirelessly to a receiver or compatible smart device*, enabling patients to receive real-time glucose data without the need to prick their finger†. The system also offers customizable alerts and alarms to help avoid dangerous low and high blood sugar events.

"The launch of Dexcom G6 in Singapore is a significant milestone for our company," said Scott Moss, VP at Dexcom, Asia-Pacific. "This launch marks the first time Dexcom CGM is available to people living with diabetes in Southeast Asia, and with the recent opening of our regional headquarters in Singapore, we look forward to bringing Dexcom CGM to additional markets in the region in the near future."

The Dexcom G6 app for compatible iOS and Android devices* also allows patients to share their glucose information with up to ten followers‡, enabling family, loved ones, and healthcare providers to remotely monitor patients for extra peace of mind.

Dexcom G6 features that empower users to take control of their health:

The Dexcom G6 CGM System connects to the Dexcom G6 app, available for download from the Apple App Store or Google Play store, for use with a compatible Apple or Android smart device. Alternatively, patients can see glucose readings on the optional Dexcom G6 touch screen receiver that can be purchased separately.

Dexcom G6 CGM received its approval from Singapore’s HSA late last year and can now be accessed by Singaporeans this month. For more information on Dexcom G6, visit www.dexcom.com/sg.
