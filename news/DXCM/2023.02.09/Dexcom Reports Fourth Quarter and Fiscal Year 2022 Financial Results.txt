2023 Annual Guidance

The company is reiterating guidance for fiscal year 2023 revenue, Non-GAAP Gross Profit Margin, and Non-GAAP Operating Margin, and establishing guidance for Adjusted EBITDA Margin at the following levels:

Fourth Quarter 2022 Financial Results

Revenue: In the fourth quarter of 2022, worldwide revenue grew 17% to $815.2 million, up from $698.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Volume growth in conjunction with strong new customer additions continues to be the primary driver of revenue growth as awareness of real-time CGM increases.

Gross Profit: GAAP gross profit totaled $541.3 million or 66.4% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $472.6 million or 67.7% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Non-GAAP gross profit* totaled $543.7 million or 66.7% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $472.6 million or 67.7% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Operating Income: GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $125.4 million, compared to GAAP operating income of $0.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2021.

Non-GAAP operating income* for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $172.1 million, compared to non-GAAP operating income of $11.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2021.

Net Income (Loss) and Net Income (Loss) per Share: GAAP net income was $91.8 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to GAAP net loss of $5.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the same quarter of 2021.

Non-GAAP net income* was $136.3 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $2.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the same quarter of 2021. The fourth quarter 2022 non-GAAP amount excludes $24.1 million of business transition and related costs, $18.4 million of intellectual property litigation costs, $4.2 million of amortization of intangible assets, and $2.2 million of tax adjustments primarily related to excess tax benefits from stock compensation vesting.

Cash and Liquidity: As of December 31, 2022, Dexcom held $2.46 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and our revolving credit facility remains undrawn. The cash balance represents significant financial and strategic flexibility as Dexcom continues to expand production capacity and explore new market opportunities.

* See Table E below for a reconciliation of these GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.

Conference Call

Management will hold a conference call today starting at 4:30 p.m. (Eastern Time). The conference call will be concurrently webcast. The link to the webcast will be available on the Dexcom Investor Relations website at investors.dexcom.com by navigating to “Events and Presentations,” and will be archived for future reference. To listen to the conference call, please dial (888) 414-4585 (US/Canada) or (646) 960-0331 (International) and use the conference id “9430114” approximately five minutes prior to the start time.

Statement Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release and the accompanying tables include non-GAAP financial measures. For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons management uses each measure, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), please see the section of the accompanying tables titled “About Non-GAAP Financial Measures” as well as the related Table E. We have not reconciled our total revenue, Non-GAAP Gross Profit Margin, Non-GAAP Operating Margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin estimates for fiscal year 2023 because certain items that impact these figures are uncertain or out of our control and cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of total revenue, Non-GAAP Gross Profit Margin, Non-GAAP Operating Margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin is not available without unreasonable effort.

We adjusted our 2021 amounts to reflect the simplified convertible instruments accounting guidance (ASU 2020-06), which we adopted on a full retrospective basis. The adoption eliminates the non-cash interest expense related to the conversion features of the convertible notes beginning in the first quarter of 2020. Further, beginning in the second quarter of 2022, we began including non-cash collaborative research and development fees incurred in our non-GAAP metrics. We have updated prior periods to conform to this new presentation. All periods presented have also been adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split.

(1)

Represents amortization of acquired intangible assets.

(2)

For the three months ended December 31, 2022, business transition and related costs are primarily related to vacating a building in San Diego, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $23 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, business transition and related costs are primarily related to consulting fees and expenses as the result of transitioning to a flexible working environment, including an impairment charge and accelerated depreciation of tenant improvements.

(3)

Represents costs related to a patent infringement lawsuit.

(4)

Represents a gain from the sale of an equity investment.

(5)

For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the tax adjustments were primarily related to the tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the tax adjustments were primarily related to excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation for employees and the Verily regulatory milestone payment. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021, tax adjustments were primarily related to the excess tax benefits from share-based compensation for employees.

(6)

When our senior convertible notes are dilutive on a GAAP or non-GAAP basis, net income used for calculating GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per share includes an interest expense add back, net of tax, under the if-converted method. In loss periods, basic and diluted net loss per share are the same since the effect of potential common shares is anti-dilutive and therefore excluded.

(7)

The adjustment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 is for the transition from GAAP diluted net income per share to non-GAAP diluted net income per share due to our 2023 and 2025 senior convertible notes.

(8)

The sum of the non-GAAP per share components may not equal the totals due to rounding.

(9)

Our 2023 senior convertible notes are dilutive on a GAAP basis for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Our 2023 senior convertible notes are anti-dilutive on a GAAP basis for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Our 2023 senior convertible notes are anti-dilutive on a non-GAAP basis for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Our 2023 senior convertible notes are also hedged through an anti-dilutive bond hedge arrangement.

(10)

Our 2025 senior convertible notes are dilutive on a GAAP basis and non-GAAP basis for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Our 2025 senior convertible notes are anti-dilutive on a GAAP basis and non-GAAP basis for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Our 2025 senior convertible notes are anti-dilutive on a GAAP basis and dilutive on a non-GAAP basis for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.

ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The accompanying press release dated February 9, 2023 contains non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share as well as adjusted EBITDA.

We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of our operating performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by senior management in our financial and operational decision making. Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization and our senior management. We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.

We report non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, differ from GAAP measures with the same names, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measures. We encourage investors to carefully consider our results under GAAP, as well as our supplemental non-GAAP information and the reconciliations between these presentations, to more fully understand our business.

Management believes that presentation of operating results that excludes these items provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of our core operating results and comparison of operating results across reporting periods. Management also believes that this supplemental non-GAAP information is therefore useful to investors in analyzing and assessing our past and future operating performance.

Table E reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures in the press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

We exclude the following items from non-GAAP financial measures for non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share:

Adjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash operating charges for share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization as well as non-operating items such as interest income, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, income and loss from equity investments, and income tax expense or benefit. For the reasons explained above, adjusted EBITDA also excludes business transition and related costs, COVID-19 costs, litigation settlement costs, and intellectual property litigation costs.
