*Starting in the first quarter of 2022, Vertex no longer excludes research and development charges resulting from upfront or contingent milestone payments in connection with collaborations, asset acquisitions and/or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights from its Non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021 have been recast to reflect this change.

Full Year 2022 Results

Product revenue increased 18% to $8.93 billion compared to 2021, primarily driven by the rapid uptake of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO in multiple countries internationally and the continued performance of TRIKAFTA in the U.S. Net product revenue in 2022 increased 8% to $5.70 billion in the U.S. and increased 41% to $3.23 billion outside the U.S., compared to 2021.

GAAP and Non-GAAP net income increased by 42% and 53%, respectively, compared to 2021, primarily due to strong product revenue growth and lower acquired in-process research and development expenses (“Acquired IPR&D”). Increased revenues were partially offset by increased investments in our mid- and late-stage clinical pipeline, the costs to support the launches of Vertex’s therapies globally, and higher income taxes. Acquired IPR&D in 2021 included a one-time $900 million payment Vertex made in connection with the amendment of the collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics in the second quarter of 2021.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2022 were $10.8 billion, compared to $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by strong revenue growth and operating cash flow, partially offset by income tax payments and our acquisition of ViaCyte.

Non-GAAP financial measures for 2021 have been recast to reflect this change.

Combined GAAP and Non-GAAP R&D, Acquired IPR&D and SG&A expenses decreased compared to 2021, primarily due to lower Acquired IPR&D as a result of the one-time $900 million payment to CRISPR in the second quarter of 2021, partially offset by increased investment in support of multiple programs that have advanced in mid- and late-stage clinical development and the costs to support launches of Vertex’s therapies globally.

GAAP and Non-GAAP income taxes increased compared to 2021, primarily due to Vertex’s increased pre-tax income resulting from strong product revenue growth and lower expenses, as a result of the $900 million payment to CRISPR in the second quarter of 2021. GAAP income taxes also included the impact of discrete tax items in both 2022 and 2021. Please refer to Note 1 for further details.

Fourth Quarter 2022 Results

Product revenue increased 11% to $2.30 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily driven by the strong uptake of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO in multiple countries internationally and continued performance of TRIKAFTA in the U.S. Net product revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 increased 5% to $1.46 billion in the U.S. and increased 24% to $842 million outside the U.S., compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.

GAAP and Non-GAAP net income increased by 6% and 26%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily driven by strong revenue growth and lower Acquired IPR&D, partially offset by increased investment in our mid- and late-stage clinical pipeline, the costs to support launches of Vertex’s therapies globally, and higher income taxes.

*Starting in the first quarter of 2022, Vertex no longer excludes research and development charges resulting from upfront or contingent milestone payments in connection with collaborations, asset acquisitions and/or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights from its Non-GAAP financial measures. These charges are included as "Acquired in-process research and development expenses," and were previously included in "Research and development expenses," in Vertex's consolidated statements of operations. Non-GAAP financial measures for the fourth quarter of 2021 have been recast to reflect this change.

Combined GAAP and Non-GAAP R&D, Acquired IPR&D and SG&A expenses increased compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, due to increased investment in support of multiple programs that have advanced in mid- and late-stage clinical development and the costs to support launches of Vertex's therapies globally.

GAAP and Non-GAAP income taxes increased compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to Vertex’s increased pre-tax income. GAAP income taxes also included the impact of discrete tax items in the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2021. Please refer to Note 1 for further details.

Share Repurchase Program

On February 1, Vertex’s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of our common stock. The program does not have an expiration date and can be discontinued at any time. Please refer to Note 2 for further details.

Full Year 2023 Financial Guidance

Vertex today provided full year 2023 financial guidance. Vertex’s CF product revenue guidance includes expectations in the U.S. for continued performance of TRIKAFTA in ages 6+ and approval and launch of TRIKAFTA in the 2-5 age group, as well as continued uptake of KAFTRIO/TRIKAFTA in ages 6+ in countries outside the U.S., including those with recent reimbursement agreements. This guidance includes an approximately 150-basis-point negative impact from changes in foreign currency rates, inclusive of our foreign exchange risk management program. Vertex’s combined Non-GAAP R&D, Acquired IPR&D and SG&A expense guidance includes expectations for continued investment in our multiple mid- and late-stage clinical development programs, commercial and manufacturing capabilities, and approximately $300 million of upfront and milestone payments from existing collaborations and our anticipated transaction with Entrada Therapeutics.

Vertex’s guidance is summarized below:

Key Business Highlights

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Marketed Products

Vertex anticipates the number of CF patients taking our medicines will continue to grow, including through new approvals for the treatment of younger patients. Recent progress includes:

Potential Near-Term Launch Opportunities

Vertex is preparing for the following potential near-term new product commercial launches:

R&D Pipeline

Vertex is delivering on a diversified pipeline of potentially transformative small molecule, mRNA, cell and genetic therapies aimed at serious diseases. Recent and anticipated progress for programs in clinical development is summarized below.

Cystic Fibrosis

Vertex continues to pursue next-in-class, small molecule CFTR modulator therapies as well as an mRNA therapy for the approximately 5,000 patients who cannot benefit from CFTR modulators alone.

Beta Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease

Exa-cel is a non-viral ex vivo CRISPR gene-editing therapy, which is being developed as a potential functional cure for TDT and SCD. Vertex is developing exa-cel in collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics.

Neuropathic Pain (NaV1.8)

Vertex has discovered multiple selective small molecule inhibitors of NaV1.8 with the objective of creating a new class of pain medicines that have the potential to provide effective pain relief, without the limitations of opioids and other currently available medicines.

APOL1-Mediated Kidney Disease (AMKD)

Vertex has discovered multiple oral, small molecule inhibitors of APOL1 function, pioneering a new class of medicines that target an underlying genetic driver of kidney disease.

Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)

Vertex is evaluating cell therapies using stem cell-derived islet cells to replace the endogenous insulin-producing islet cells that are destroyed in people with T1D, with the goal of developing a potential functional cure for this disease.

Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency

Vertex is working to address the underlying genetic cause of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency by developing novel small molecule correctors of Z-AAT protein folding, with a goal of increasing the secretion of functional AAT into the blood and addressing both the lung and the liver aspects of AAT deficiency.

Other Internal Innovation and Pre-Clinical Development

Consistent with its overall strategy, Vertex takes a portfolio approach to all of its programs, with additional assets in CF, SCD, TDT, AMKD, T1D, pain and AATD in earlier stages of development.

Vertex is also bringing forward preclinical assets in new disease areas, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Additionally, Vertex is working on preclinical molecules with the potential to expand our leadership in existing disease areas, including assets targeting gentler conditioning for exa-cel and NaV1.7 in pain.

Investments in External Innovation

Consistent with its strategy to develop transformative medicines for serious diseases, Vertex previously announced a global research collaboration with Entrada Therapeutics focused on therapeutics for DM1. The collaboration includes Entrada’s program for DM1, ENTR-701, which is in late preclinical development. Under the terms of the agreement, upon closing, which is anticipated to occur this month, Vertex will make an upfront payment of approximately $224 million to Entrada, as well as an equity investment of approximately $26 million.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In this press release, Vertex's financial results and financial guidance are provided in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and using certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, non-GAAP financial results and guidance exclude from Vertex's pre-tax income (i) stock-based compensation expense, (ii) gains or losses related to the fair value of the company's strategic investments, (iii) increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration, (iv) acquisition-related costs, (v) an intangible asset impairment charge and (vi) other adjustments. The company's non-GAAP financial results also exclude from its provision for income taxes the estimated tax impact related to its non-GAAP adjustments to pre-tax income described above and certain discrete items. These results should not be viewed as a substitute for the company’s GAAP results and are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the company's business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results and provide additional information regarding the company's financial position that the company believes is helpful to an understanding of its ongoing business. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures to establish budgets and operational goals that are communicated internally and externally, to manage the company's business and to evaluate its performance. The company’s calculation of non-GAAP financial measures likely differs from the calculations used by other companies. A reconciliation of the GAAP financial results to non-GAAP financial results is included in the attached financial information.

The company provides guidance regarding combined R&D, Acquired IPR&D and SG&A expenses and effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis. Unless otherwise noted, the guidance regarding combined GAAP and non-GAAP R&D, Acquired IPR&D and SG&A expenses does not include estimates associated with any potential future business development transactions, including collaborations, asset acquisitions and/or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights. The company does not provide guidance regarding its GAAP effective tax rate because it is unable to forecast with reasonable certainty the impact of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and the possibility of certain discrete items, which could be material.

*Starting in the first quarter of 2022, Vertex no longer excludes research and development charges resulting from upfront or contingent milestone payments in connection with collaborations, asset acquisitions and/or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights from its Non-GAAP financial measures. These charges are included as "Acquired in-process research and development expenses," and were previously included in "Research and development expenses," in Vertex's consolidated statements of operations. Non-GAAP financial measures for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021 have been recast to reflect this change.

Notes and Explanations

1: In the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, "Tax adjustments" included the estimated income taxes related to non-GAAP adjustments to the company's pre-tax income and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. "Tax adjustments" in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022 also included $60 million of net discrete tax expense related to our uncertain tax positions associated with intercompany transfer pricing matters partially offset by changes in our estimated prior-year tax liabilities. "Tax adjustments" in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021 included a $44 million discrete benefit resulting from the conclusion of an R&D tax credit study. The twelve months ended December 31, 2021 also included a $95 million discrete tax benefit related to an increase in the U.K.'s corporate tax rate from 19% to 25%, which was enacted in June 2021 and will become effective in April 2023.

2: Under our share repurchase program, the company may repurchase stock from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans.

3: The difference between the company’s full year 2023 combined GAAP R&D, Acquired IPR&D and SG&A expenses and combined non-GAAP R&D, Acquired IPR&D and SG&A expenses guidance relates primarily to $440 million to $575 million of stock-based compensation expense. Unless otherwise noted, the guidance regarding combined GAAP and non-GAAP R&D, Acquired IPR&D and SG&A expenses does not include estimates associated with any potential future business development transactions, including collaborations, asset acquisitions and/or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights.

4: Vertex classifies upfront, contingent milestone, and other payments pursuant to its business development transactions, including collaborations, licenses of third-party technologies, and asset acquisitions as “Acquired in-process research and development expenses” in its consolidated statements of operations in cases where such acquired assets do not have an alternative future use. These amounts were previously classified as "Research and development expenses." To conform prior periods to current presentation, the company reclassified $127 million and $1.1 billion from “Research and development expenses” to “Acquired in-process research and development expenses” for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, "Acquired in-process research and development expenses" primarily related to the $900 million upfront payment to CRISPR.

5: "Other (expense) income, net" includes net gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the company's strategic investments.

6: In June 2022, the company revised the scope of certain acquired programs, resulting in a $13 million “Intangible asset impairment charge” and a decrease in the associated fair value of contingent consideration.

7: "Acquisition-related costs" in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 related to costs associated with the company's acquisitions of Exonics and ViaCyte.

Note: Amounts may not foot due to rounding.
