CAMARILLO - Semtech Corporation (Nasdaq: SMTC), a high-performance semiconductor, IoT systems and Cloud connectivity service provider, today announced the successful demonstration of a 200G per lane (200G/lane) optical transmission link enabled by Semtech's latest FiberEdge 200G PAM4 PMDs and Broadcom's latest generation DSP PHY.In collaboration with Keysight Technologies Inc., Semtech and Broadcom will be conducting a live demonstration based on Semtech's state-of-the-art FiberEdge 200G PAM4 EML Driver and TIA and Broadcom's leading-edge 5nm 112GBd PAM4 DSP platform in Semtech's booth #1901 and Broadcom's booth #6425 at the Optical Fiber Communication (OFC) 2023 exhibition in San Diego, California from March 7 to 9.With the ever-increasing demand for faster data processing and communication, Semtech's FiberEdge 200G PAM4 PMDs, combined with Broadcom's new 200G/lane DSP, provide the ideal solution to meet the high bandwidth requirements of next-generation data centers, delivering unprecedented levels of performance, bandwidth, speed and reliability for data communication systems. Further, it is a highly scalable solution enabling optical modules to support data rates up to 3.2 Tbps. Rapid deployment of the next generation of 51.2T switches in data center networks and high-performance computing is contingent on the maturity of optics based on next generation 200G/lane optical modules.'We are very excited to collaborate with Broadcom and Keysight in this joint demonstration that showcases Semtech's 200G PMDs and their interoperability with Broadcom's cutting edge 200G/lane DSP and Keysight's latest 200G equipment,' said Nicola Bramante, senior product line manager for Semtech's Signal Integrity Products Group. 'The demonstration proves the performance of a 200G/lane ecosystem, paving the way for the deployment of next generation's terabit optical transceivers in data centers.''This collaboration with Semtech and Keysight, two of the primary ecosystem enablers, is key to the next generation of optical modules that will deliver increased bandwidth in hyperscale cloud networks. This achievement demonstrates our commitment to pushing the boundaries of high-speed connectivity, and we are excited to continue working with industry leaders to drive innovation and deliver cutting-edge solutions to our customers,' said Khushrow Machhi, senior director of marketing of the Physical Layer Products Division at Broadcom.'Semtech's and Broadcom's successful demonstration of the 200Gb/s optical link is another important milestone for the industry towards ubiquitous future 800G and 1.6T networks. Keysight's early engagement with leading customers and continuous investments in technology and tools deliver the needed insights that enable these milestones,' said Dr. Joachim Peerlings, vice president and general manager of Keysight's Network and Data Center Solutions Group.About Semtech's Optical ProductsSemtech's optical networking product platforms provide high-performance signal integrity for optical module solutions used by leading companies in the data center/enterprise networking, wireless infrastructure and passive optical network/Fiber to the X markets.About SemtechSemtech Corporation (Nasdaq: SMTC) is a high-performance semiconductor, IoT systems and Cloud connectivity service provider dedicated to delivering high quality technology solutions that enable a smarter, more connected and sustainable planet.
