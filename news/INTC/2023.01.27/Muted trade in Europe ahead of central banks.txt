Stock market traders in Europe showed signs of nerves ahead of a busy week of central banking decisions, with the policy meetings for the Bank of England, European Central Bank and US Federal Reserve on the horizon.

Markets overwhelmingly expect a 25 basis point hike from the central bank, according to the CME FedWatch tool.At its last meeting in December, the Fed increased rates by 50 basis points."The recent decline in inflation has increased the probability of a further reduction in the size of the Fed's rate hikes to 25 bps in February, from 50 bps in December," analysts at Rabobank commented."We continue to think that based on the fading momentum of inflation, the [Federal Open Market Committee] is likely to stop at a 4.75-5.00% target range and pause for the remainder of the year."The Bank of England is expected to maintain the pace of its rate hikes at 50 basis point, according to consensus cited by FXStreet. The ECB is also forecast to hike by half a point again. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was marginally lower, the S&P 500 was slightly higher and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.4%."The early year enthusiasm appears to have given way to a little bit of caution as we look to next week's trifecta of central bank meetings, and what sort of outlook is painted by the Federal Reserve, ECB and Bank of England, and more importantly how many more rate hikes can we expect to see after next week," CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson commented.

The Santa Clara, California-based CPU and semiconductor manufacturer reported net revenue of USD14.04 billion in the fourth quarter to December 30, down 32% from USD20.53 billion a year before. "UK-based investors may look at Intel's weak fourth quarter in 2022 and stink-bomb guidance for the first quarter of 2023 and just shrug, in the view that Intel's dreadful share price performance means this is not really news, and it is nothing to do with them anyway â€“ but they just might be wrong," AJ Bell analyst Russ Mould commented."Stock markets are rising as they believe inflation will ease, there will only be a mild recession and interest rates will be able to gently slide lower, but Intel's warning of weak PC demand, sagging server volumes and an inventory bulge challenges that oh-so-cosy consensus."In London, Sainsbury's added 5.5%, closing as the best FTSE 100 performer.Bestway Group said it has bought or agreed to buy 80.8 million shares in the grocer, a 3.5% stake.Bestway is a London-based conglomerate, with operations across the UK, Pakistan and the Middle East.
