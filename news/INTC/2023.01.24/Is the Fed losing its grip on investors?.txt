Wall Street Futures were consolidating this morning after a rally in the previous session led by hopes of a slowdown in the Fed’s rate hikes. One of the central bank’s governor Christopher Waller said on Friday he is in favor of a 25-basis-point rate increase at the next meeting.

 
I'm not sure that central banks are looking favorably on the current rush to buy risky assets, because it probably comes a bit early in relation to their hidden agenda. Let me explain. In the US, the Fed needs to keep some negative pressure on the economy to ensure that inflation continues to fall and that prices move closer to the economically optimal range of about 2%. If the economy picks up too soon, fueled in particular by the return of positive sentiment in the financial markets, the central bank's efforts so far may have been in vain.
Equity markets are currently saying "your rate ceiling is about to be hit, we can see a return to a more accommodative monetary policy in the long run". And the bond market is moving in the same direction. Not as exuberantly, of course, but in the same direction. The yield on 10-year US debt, at 3.52% this morning, is a far cry from its October peaks. In fact, if we superimpose the chart of the US 10-year and the Nasdaq, we can see that the technology index has been rising when the bond yield has been falling, and vice versa since October. There is nothing new in this, but the link is particularly clear at the moment.
The Nasdaq gained more than 2% yesterday, after having already gained more than 2% in the previous session. The index was pulled by Apple (+2.3%) and by the entire semiconductor segment: Nvidia, Qualcomm and Advanced Micro Devices all recovered more than 6%. The S&P500 (+1.2%) and the Dow Jones (+0.8%) benefited by taking the lead. In Europe, green was everywhere, but in more modest proportions.
The multi-billion dollar question now is whether the Fed feels it needs to put its house in order, so as not to lose its grip again. Last week, attempts to reframe some of the U.S. central bank's pundits failed. And there will be no hawkish outbursts in the days to come, as we have entered the statutory period of silence since Saturday, which precedes the February 1 monetary policy decision. The market is 100% confident that a rate hike limited to 25 basis points will occur. The contrarian spirits have evaporated. But the issue will likely lie in the speech presenting the decision that will follow. Jerome Powell has often been called a "goldilocks" in the past. Not because of his California surfer hairdo, but rather for his ability to stay in the tepid zone, that is, neither too hot nor too cold, like the little bear's bowl in the tale. But the risk at the moment is that Goldilocks will turn into a papa bear and that he will raise his big voice to calm the current speculative ardor.
In other news, January leading PMI indicators are driving today’s session. For the record, these are highly valued activity indicators for the major economies. They’ve already been published in the eurozone and show an improvement, raising hopes that the EU will avoid a recession. In the US, as I write these lines, contraction is expected to dominate, but any change will be subject to interpretation in terms of the possible consequences for monetary policy. If the data is more robust than expected, it would be reassuring from a macroeconomic point of view, but could lead the stock markets to be more cautious about the evolution of rates. Conversely, worse data would reinforce the scenario of a Fed forced to return to a more accommodative policy, while at the same time raising fears of recession. We are still far from an exact science. 
On another note, earnings season takes off today with several US heavyweights, including Johnson & Johnson, Danaher and Verizon that published before the Wall Street opening and Microsoft or Texas Instruments after the close.
Finally, I would like to inform you that this column will take a three-day break, since I will be busy participating in MarketScreener’s corporate seminar!
