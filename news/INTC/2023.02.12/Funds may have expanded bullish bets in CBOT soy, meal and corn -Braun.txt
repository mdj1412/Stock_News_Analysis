NAPERVILLE, Ill., Feb 12 (Reuters) - Price strength
since late January implies money managers may have increased or
at least maintained overall bullishness across Chicago grains
and oilseeds, though confirmation remains absent amid a data
delay.As of late January, large speculators held moderate to large
net long positions across CBOT corn, soybeans and soybean
products, and those collectively outweighed their sizable net
short in CBOT wheat.A ransomware attack on ION Markets earlier this month
prevented customers from collecting and reporting daily
positions to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.As a result, CFTC has so far postponed the Feb. 3 and Feb.
10 publications of its weekly Commitments of Traders (COT) data,
stating on Friday that it still had not received sufficient
information. The report will resume once the remaining data is
collected, but the possible timing is unknown.The last COT report was released Jan. 27 and covered the
week ended Jan. 24, so intel on various market participants’
positioning has been unavailable ever since. CBOT futures have
mostly strengthened since then.Close market watchers believe money managers were strong net
buyers of CBOT soybean, wheat and soymeal futures from Jan. 25
through Feb. 10. Funds were also seen as modest buyers of corn
and modest sellers of soyoil during the period.MARKET ACTIVITYBetween Jan. 25 and Feb. 10, CBOT soybean meal futures
rose 8.6%, the most of any grain or oilseed contract.
That includes a top of $501 per short ton on Feb. 10, the
most-active’s highest since June 2014, motivated by further
deterioration of drought-stricken soybeans in Argentina.Most-active soybeans rose 3.6% in that 13-day stretch,
reaching an 8-session high of $15.43-1/4 per bushel on Friday
and settling just below. CBOT soybean oil is the only
grain or oilseed to have fallen since Jan. 25, ending the period
down 0.7% but having dropped as much as 4.2%.Most-active CBOT wheat futures climbed 7% during the
13 sessions, on Friday hitting $7.90 per bushel, their highest
since Jan. 3. Escalating tensions between major wheat exporters
Ukraine and Russia were in focus at the end of last week.Black Sea concerns and worsening crops in Argentina also
helped CBOT corn drift 0.5% higher in the last 13 days,
ending at $6.80-1/2 per bushel Friday. Corn has been the most
mild-mannered of CBOT contracts since Jan. 25, trading up or
down by less than 2% since then.ESTIMATESAs of Jan. 24, money managers’ net long position in CBOT
corn futures and options hit an 11-week high of 201,797
contracts. They had sold a huge chunk of soybeans in the week
ended Jan. 24, dropping their net long to 146,261 futures and
options contracts.In the week ended Jan. 24, money managers sold soymeal
futures and options for the first time since late November,
reducing their net long to 135,503 contracts from the record
150,939 a week earlier. They also sold soyoil for a fourth
straight week, cutting their net long to 35,961 contracts, the
lowest since mid-August.Money managers as of Jan. 24 held their most bearish stance
in CBOT wheat since May 2019 with a net short of 73,933 futures
and options contracts, having been net sellers in 12 of the
latest 16 weeks.Daily estimates collected by Reuters suggest that in the 13
sessions through Feb. 10, commodity funds were net buyers of
22,500 CBOT wheat futures. Money managers have not bought or
sold more than 22,500 wheat futures and options contracts in a
two-week stretch since March 2022, so the trade estimates may be
high.Funds are pegged to have bought 16,000 soymeal futures in
that period, implying the net long as of Friday was challenging
the record. Net buying in soybeans and corn is seen at 21,500
and 2,500 futures contracts, respectively, and soyoil selling is
predicted at 2,500 contracts.The daily fund estimates should serve as a loose guide, but
they have been wrong in the past. One notable time occurred in
early 2019 when the U.S. government shut down for 35 days,
cutting off data from both the CFTC and the Department of
Agriculture.Unbeknownst to the market, money managers during that period
sold their entire net long position in CBOT corn, which was
around 128,000 contracts when the shutdown began in
mid-December. Futures declined only 2% during the stretch and
analysts wrongly assumed funds had maintained bullishness.
