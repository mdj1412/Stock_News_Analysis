This presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures. Intel revenue, gross margin, and earnings per share, including year-over-year comparisons, are presented on a non-GAAP basis except with respect to our Q4 2022 and FY 2022 revenue, Q1 2023 revenue outlook, or as otherwise indicated. This presentation also includes a non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow (FCF) measure. The Appendix provides a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by Intel should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to "Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures" in Intel's quarterly earnings release for a detailed explanation of the adjustments made to the comparable GAAP measures, the ways management uses the non-GAAP measures, and the reasons why management believes the non-GAAP measures provide investors with useful supplemental information.
