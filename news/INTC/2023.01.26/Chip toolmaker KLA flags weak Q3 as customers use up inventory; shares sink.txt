*Sees slowest growth in 16 quarters in Jan-March period*Customers supplying end-users from stockpiles amid weak
demand*KLA forecast below estimates, shares drop 5%Jan 26 (Reuters) - U.S. chip toolmaker KLA Corp
on Thursday forecast its slowest growth in 16 quarters for the
January-March period, saying it expects customers to whittle
down existing stockpiles of chips as demand from end-users
slows.The company's revenue and profit outlook for the current
third quarter was below Wall Street estimates, sending its
shares down 5% in trading after the bell.Milpitas, California-based KLA, which supplies chipmaking
equipment for companies like Intel Corp and Asia's TSMC
, is the latest company to warn that demand is slumping
as people buy fewer smartphones and gadgets, and recession-wary
businesses tighten spending on data centers."Looking at 2023, we know that this will be a year of
industry capacity adjustments as customers fine-tune their capex
(capital expenditure) plan to address decreased demand in some
segments," KLA Chief Executive Richard Wallace said in a
conference call.Intel said on Thursday it expects "some of the largest
inventory corrections literally that we've ever seen in the
industry" to hurt its March quarter. TSMC said earlier this
month it would slash its annual investments.KLA had earlier said its systems and service revenue could
be affected in the near term by U.S. export regulations on the
sale of semiconductor technology to China.On Thursday, however, it said it expects business in China
to decline less than overall chip demand in 2023.The company expects third-quarter revenue between $2.2
billion and $2.5 billion, below analysts' average expectation of
$2.55 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES.It expects an adjusted profit of $4.52 to $5.92 per share in
the period, the mid-point being below an average expectation of
$5.89.KLA, whose stock had risen 13% in the past year and touched
a high for the year during normal trading hours on Thursday,
however, beat estimates for the October-December quarter.
