            Despite the economic and market headwinds, we continued to make good progress on our strategic transformation in Q4, including advancing our product roadmap and improving our operational structure and processes to drive efciencies while delivering at the low-end of our guided range. In 2023, we will continue
          

            to navigate the short-term challenges while striving to meet our long-term commitments, including delivering leadership products anchored on open and secure platforms, powered by at-scale manufacturing and supercharged by our incredible team.

          Abbreviations:
        

          =Record revenue; Q4 (fourth-quarter); YoY (year-over-year); GAAP (general accepted accounting principles); EPS (earnings per share); FY (full-year).
        

          Q4'22 non-GAAP EPS ($0.10) is Q4'22 GAAP EPS (-$0.16) after adjustment for acquisition-related adjustments (+$0.09), share-based compensation (+$0.18), Optane inventory impairment (+$0.04), restructuring and other charges (+$0.11), gain on equity investments, net (-$0.04), gain from divestiture (-$0.01), tax reform (-$0.06) and income tax efects (-$0.05). FY'22 non-GAAP EPS ($1.84) is FY'22 GAAP EPS ($1.94) after adjustment for acquisition-related adjustments (+$0.37), share-based compensation (+$0.76), patent settlement (+$0.05), Optane inventory impairment (+$0.18), gain on equity investments, net (-$1.04), gain from divestiture (-$0.28), tax reform (-$0.20) and income tax efects (+$0.06). FY'22 non-GAAP adjusted free cash fow (-$4.1B) is FY'22 GAAP cash from operations ($15.4B) after adjustment for additions to property, plant and equipment, net of proceeds from capital grants and partner contributions (-$23.7B), payments on fnance leases (-$0.4B) and proceeds from McAfee equity sale (+$4.6M). For a full explanation of these non-GAAP measures, see Intel's Q4 and FY'22 earnings release at intc.com. Year-over-year comparisons, including for Intel Q4 and FY'22 revenue, exclude NAND memory business from 2021 results. We completed the frst closing of the divestiture on December 29, 2021. Year-over-year comparisons also exclude share-based compensation and gains/losses on equity investments. Graphic omits intersegment and All Other revenue. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2022, the impact of non-controlling interest to our non-GAAP adjustments is insignifcant and thus is not included in our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.
