session higher on Thursday as investors grappled with an
onslaught of economic data and a string of mixed corporate
earnings, all while eyeing the clock as it ticks down toward
next week's Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting.While all three major U.S. stock indexes advanced, megacap
momentum stocks, buoyed by Tesla Inc's earnings beat
and upbeat sales forecast, helped put the Nasdaq in the lead.A raft of data showed the U.S. economy fared better in the
fourth quarter than analysts expected, and the labor market
remains tight, despite some signs of weakening demand. This is a
double-edged sword for investors, as it could embolden the Fed
to keep key interest rates at restrictive levels for longer.While financial markets have largely priced in a 25 basis
point rate from the central bank next Wednesday, that sentiment
is not unanimous."The economic data had something in it for everybody; for
the dreamers who think the economy is just slow enough to put
the Fed on hold, and the pessimists who think growth is still
too hot for the Fed to step away," said David Carter, managing
director at JPMorgan Private Bank in New York."Hope is not an investment strategy, and the economic
facts could soon weigh on the market," Carter added. "The
biggest uncertainty is what will happen in the back half of this
year."Fourth-quarter earnings season has hit full stride, with
more than one fourth of the companies in the S&P 500 having
reported. Of those, 69% have beaten consensus estimates, up from
67% on Wednesday, according to Refinitiv.Analysts now see aggregate fourth quarter earnings falling
2.7%, worse than the 1.6% year-on-year decline seen on Jan. 1,
but an improvement over the 3% annual decline as of Wednesday,
per Refinitiv.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 205.57 points,
or 0.61%, to 33,949.41, the S&P 500 gained 44.21 points,
or 1.10%, to 4,060.43 and the Nasdaq Composite added
199.06 points, or 1.76%, to 11,512.41.Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, all but consumer
staples advanced. Energy led the percentage
gainers, boosted byrising crude pricesdue to signs of increasing demand from China.Tesla Inc provided one of the heftiest boosts
to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, its shares jumping11.0% in the wake of its earnings report.Chevron Corpannouncedit would triple its budget for share buybacks, which sent
the oil major's stock up4.9%.Among losers, IBM Corp fell4.5% in the wake of itsannouncementthat it would cut jobs divest some assets after falling
short of its annual cash target.Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond Ink plunged22.2% after the home goods retailer received adefault noticefrom JPMorgan Chase.Southwest Airlines Co slid3.2% afterwarningof current quarter losses.And despite forecasts of strong demand for air travel in
2023, the broader S&P 1500 Airlines index dropped0.9%.That might have something to do with Mastercard Inc'sdisappointingcurrent quarter revenue forecast, cited an expected
diminishing pent-up travel demand. The consumer payments
company's shares dipped1.3%.Shares of Intel Corp dropped as much as 6% in
extended trading after the companypostedrevenue below Street expectations.Mastercard rival Visa Inc gained nearly 2% after
hours following itreporteda rise in quarterly profit due to resilient consumer
spending.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE
by a 2.35-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored
advancers.The S&P 500 posted 23 new 52-week highs and no new lows;
the Nasdaq Composite recorded 111 new highs and 32 new lows.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.34 billion shares,
compared with the 10.93 billion average over the last 20 trading
days.
