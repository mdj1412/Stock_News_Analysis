March 21 (Reuters) - Raja Koduri, the chief architect at
Intel Corp, is leaving to start a company that aims to
loosen longtime rival Nvidia Corp's grip on the digital
movie and video game markets.Koduri, whose departure was announced by Intel Chief
Executive Pat Gelsinger in a tweet on Tuesday, told Reuters his
as-yet-unnamed company will aim to make a new wave of so-called
generative artificial intelligence tools that work on chips from
Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, Apple Inc or
even future chips based on open-source RISC-V technology.New software tools can generate fresh imagery from just a
text prompt and hold great promise for fields like visual
effects and video games, Koduri said. But they typically are
designed to work only on Nvidia chips.Koduri said his first efforts will be aimed at creating a
service that lets movie and game artists easily use those AI
tools whether they are using a PC, Mac, iPad or other device
without having to dive deep into software code.Those artists "are not technical. They just get baffled by
all this stuff," Koduri said.Koduri, a veteran of Advanced Micro Devices and
Apple Inc, joined Intel five years ago. He was part of
a wave of outsiders hired by Intel, which had been known in the
chip industry for promoting executives from within, to rethink
the company's approach as it lost market share to rivals.But Koduri, who has worked on nearly two dozen generations
of computer graphics chips, has also had a long interest in
movies. More than a decade ago, he helped fund a special effects
firm in India called Makuta Effects that will be rolled into the
new venture, and one of his cousins recently won an Oscar for
work on the Telugu blockbuster "RRR."Though he declined to give a dollar figure, Koduri said he
has raised a round of seed funding for his new venture and that
it will have a major presence in India as well as Singapore and
the United States.He said the company would work on software to support chips
made with open-source technology such as RISC-V."Any RISC-V based or open architecture based hardware that's
available, we will be the first user to give them feedback and
encourage them," he said. "Because to truly democratize AI
computing for everybody, we have got to get the cost down
dramatically."
