*Q4 net profit 1.82 bln euros (analysts: 1.70 billion)*Revenue 6.43 bln euros (analysts: 6.38 billion euros)*Order backlog record high 40 bln eurosVELDHOVEN, Netherlands, Jan 25 (Reuters) - ASML Holding
NV, Europe's largest technology company, beat
fourth-quarter earnings forecasts on Wednesday and forecast a
rise more than 25% in 2023 sales despite possible new curbs on
its exports to China.The maker of equipment to produce semiconductors has
struggled to meet demand as top customers TSMC,
Samsung and Intel are all engaged in major
expansions.It said its order backlog had grown to a record 40 billion
euros ($43.62 billion) at the end of the year.Credit Suisse analysts said the earnings may be "taken
negatively" by the market, given recent rallies in the company's
share price, up 22% in January and up 55% from October lows."However, ASMLâ€™s structural prospects remain unchanged,"
they said in a note.Shares were down 1.7% at 605.40 euros at 0744 GMT.CEO Peter Wennink said that although the economic outlook
for 2023 is clouded by worries over the economy and growing
semiconductor inventories, customers also see conditions
improving toward the end of the year and China's economy
recovering after the end of COVID-19 curbs."That means that the demand is still higher than what we can
make," he said.CHINAThe numbers come a week after U.S. President Joe Biden and
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte discussed possible new export
restrictions on some of ASML's sales to customers in China due
to security concerns.Wennink currently said "nothing has changed" regarding
ASML's exports to China despite the United States imposing new
export restrictions on its own companies in October.""We just have to wait for the governments and the
politicians to keep talking and come to a reasonable solution
(on possible restrictions)," Wennink said."We can still ship DUV (older) ... tools" to mainland China,
Wennink said.The company had China sales worth 2.16 billion euros in 2022
accounting for 14% of its total revenue. It was the firm's third
biggest market behind Taiwan and South Korea.Veldhoven, Netherlands-based ASML reported fourth-quarter
net profit of 1.82 billion euros, up from 1.77 billion a year
earlier, on revenue of 6.43 billion euros.That beat analyst forecasts for a net profit of 1.70 billion
euros on sales of 6.38 billion, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.($1 = 0.9169 euros)
