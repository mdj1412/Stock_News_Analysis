*Chip profit lowest since Q1 2009*Analysts expect chip business to report Q1 loss*Company flags organic chip production curb*Says demand to recover starting H2SEOUL, Jan 31 (Reuters) - South Korea's Samsung
Electronics Co Ltd on Tuesday indicated it has no
plan to cut investment in chips this year, even as a weak global
economy condemns the industry to its worst downturn in over a
decade.The guidance bucks a broader industry trend to scale back
spending and output, fanning concern that the world's biggest
memory chipmaker intends to draw on its deep pockets and
superior profit margins to gain market share from smaller peers."Samsung might be seeing this time as a good opportunity to
increase market share, which should help it in the long term, at
the expense of SK Hynix and Micron," said analyst Choi Yoo-june
at Shinhan Securities.Greg Roh, head of research at Hyundai Motor Securities,
estimated Samsung Electronics' market share may reach the upper
40% range for DRAM chips and mid-30% range for NAND flash memory
chips in the second half of the year, from around 43% and 32%.Instead of cutting investment in response to slowing demand
and falling prices, Samsung signaled it would curb short-term
production organically through line maintenance, equipment
adjustment and moving to advanced chipmaking processes. It also
said it would increase the proportion of capital investment that
goes into research and development."Samsung, in a roundabout way, is saying production will
decrease slightly," said analyst Kim Yang-jae at Daol Investment
and Securities. "However, investors were hoping for a stronger
production cut, or a comment about faster market rebound - so
its shares fell."The share prices of Samsung and compatriot SK Hynix Inc
fell 3% and 2.2% respectively on Tuesday.Samsung said capital spending in 2023 would be similar to
2022, in contrast to SK Hynix and Micron Technology Inc
which have said they would slash investment. In contract
chipmaking, bigger rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co
Ltd has also announced a spending cut.The global technology industry has been battling a sharp and
sudden downturn in demand since late last year, as companies cut
spending on tech products and services while consumers spend
less on discretionary goods in the face of surging inflation.CHIP PROFIT TUMBLESEarlier on Tuesday, Samsung reported its lowest quarterly
profit since 2014 and said persistent macroeconomic uncertainty
will make for a tough first half of this year, though it expects
demand to start recovering in the second half.Sluggish demand and inventory adjustment will continue to
impact the chip business in the first quarter, while smartphone
demand is likely to decline year-on-year due to economic
slowdown in major regions, Samsung said.At 4.3 trillion won ($3.49 billion), October-December
operating profit was Samsung's lowest quarterly profit in eight
years. Revenue fell 8% to 70.5 trillion won.With memory chip prices falling by double-digit percentages
in 2022, Samsung's chip profit tumbled - to about 270 billion
won in the fourth quarter from 8.83 trillion won a year earlier,
marking the lowest since the first quarter of 2009.Some analysts expect the chip business to book a loss in the
first quarter, pulling overall profit below that of the fourth.Last week, chipmaker Intel Corp said it expects to
lose money in the current quarter as the personal computer
industry experiences a chip glut.In mobile, Samsung said fourth-quarter profit fell to 1.7
trillion won from 2.66 trillion won a year earlier, as a decline
in low- and mid-end smartphone sales was greater than expected.Samsung plans to unveil its latest Galaxy S flagship
smartphones later this week.($1 = 1,232.6000 won)
