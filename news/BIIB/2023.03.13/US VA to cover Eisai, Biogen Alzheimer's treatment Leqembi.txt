March 13 (Reuters) - Eisai Co Ltd and Biogen
Inc said on Monday that the U.S. Department of Veteran
Affairs (VA) will provide coverage of their Alzheimer's
treatment Leqembi to veterans at an early stage of the
memory-robbing disease.The VA did not immediately respond to a request for comment,
but a document on its website shows that the agency added
Leqembi to its list nonformulary drugs, making it available
provided patients request it, receive prior approval, and meet
strict inclusion criteria for the drug's use.The VA's coverage comes as initial patient access to the
recently approved drug remains limited by a number of factors
including reimbursement restrictions by the government's
Medicare health program for Americans aged 65 and older, who
represent some 90% of individuals likely to be eligible for
Leqembi.The companies set an initial annual price of about $26,500
for Leqembi.The drug, known chemically as lecanemab, belongs to a class
of antibody treatments designed to slow advance of the
neurodegenerative disease by removing sticky clumps of the toxic
protein beta amyloid from the brain.Leqembi has so far been approved in the U.S. under the Food
and Drug Administration's accelerated review program. Medicare
currently restricts drugs in its class approved under that
pathway.The treatment is currently undergoing the FDA's standard
review process, which will weigh its impact on cognitive
function.Eisai and Biogen have said they expect full U.S. approval
for Leqembi by summer or late this year, which would likely open
up coverage by Medicare and other health insurers.(Reporting by Ahmed Aboulenein in Washington and Pratik Jain in
