roughly $20,000 per year, while William Blair analyst Myles
Minter late last year forecast a price closer to $28,000 given
its most recent data.The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), a
drug pricing research group, said the treatment would be cost

drug, known chemically as lecanemab, via its accelerated
approval pathway in people with the early stages of the
