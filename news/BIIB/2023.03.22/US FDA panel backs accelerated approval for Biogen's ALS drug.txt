March 22 (Reuters) - A panel of advisers to the U.S.
drug regulator voted that data on Biogen Inc's
experimental treatment for ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's
disease, shows that the drug could work, potentially paving the
way for an accelerated approval.While the panel was divided on whether there was enough
evidence to show the drug works, it voted in favor of data that
showed the neurological disorder drug, tofersen, reduced levels
of protein neurofilament in patients.Neurofilament is considered a potential marker of nerve cell
degeneration.In a late-stage study, tofersen reduced levels of
neurofilament, but failed to meet the main goal of reducing
symptoms in patients with fast-progressing ALS.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel's vote was
as expected and supportive of the drug's accelerated approval,
said SVB Securities analyst Marc Goodman.The FDA generally follows the advise of its experts, though
it is not bound to do so.In a second vote, the panel said there was not enough
convincing evidence to show the effectiveness of tofersen for
the disease, reducing the chances of a full approval for now."I think it meets the evidentiary standards for accelerated
approval but not for full approval," said panelist Robert
Alexander, a neurologist.If tofersen is approved under the agency's accelerated
approval pathway, a confirmatory trial will need to show the
drug provides a clinical benefit for it to remain in the market.ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, leads to progressive
paralysis and death. Its cause is largely unknown.Biogen and partner Ionis are seeking approval to
treat ALS patients with mutations in a specific gene that leads
to toxic buildup of a protein known as superoxide dismutase 1.
