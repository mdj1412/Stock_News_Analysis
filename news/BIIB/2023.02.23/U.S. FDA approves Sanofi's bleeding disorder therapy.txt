Feb 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
has approved Sanofi SA's therapy to treat a type of
inherited bleeding disorder known as hemophilia A and expects to
launch it in the United States in April, the French drugmaker
said on Thursday.Sanofi's replacement therapy – Altuviiio – is entering a
market dominated by rivals like Takeda Pharmaceutical,
Bayer AG and Novo Nordisk, which sell
factor replacement therapies that have been the standard
treatment for decades.Factor replacement therapies replace the missing blood
clotting factor so that blood can clot properly by injecting
treatment products into a person's vein.Sanofi's drug is likely to be considered one of the best in
that class, said Damien Conover, Morningstar analyst, ahead of
the approval."We see 2.3 billion euros of peak sales globally," said
Barclays analyst Emily Field.The average annual cost of existing clotting factor
therapies is roughly $300,000, and at least two analysts ahead
of the approval estimated the price of Sanofi's drug to be
slightly at a premium to the traditional factor therapies.Sanofi, which developed the drug along with Swedish
drugmaker Sobi, said it will price Altuviiio at
parity to the annual cost of treating a prophylaxis patient on
Eloctate.The French drugmaker gained access to Elocate and Altuviiio
through a $11.6-billion buyout of U.S. hemophilia specialist
Bioverativ in 2018, which was separated from Biogen Inc.The FDA approval also provides patients an alternative to
Roche's blockbuster drug, Hemlibra, which is the market
leader for this indication."I think that most doctors are thinking that at least in the
first couple of years of the launch Altuviiio would only take
share from the other factor therapies and not from Hemlibra,"
said Field.Hemophilia A is a genetic disorder caused by missing or
defective factor VIII, a clotting protein.
