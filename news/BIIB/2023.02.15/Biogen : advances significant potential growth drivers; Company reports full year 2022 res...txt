      •Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP and Non-GAAP cost of sales includes approximately $36 million of idle capacity charges. Eisai Co., Ltd.'s (Eisai) share of these charges (approximately $18 million) is reflected in collaboration profit sharing. Full year 2022 GAAP and Non-GAAP cost of sales includes approximately $119 million of idle capacity charges. Eisai's share of these charges (approximately $55 million) is reflected in collaboration profit sharing.
    




      •Full year 2022 GAAP and Non-GAAP cost of sales includes approximately $286 million in charges associated with the write-off of inventory and purchase commitments in excess of forecasted demand related to ADUHELM. Eisai's share of these charges (approximately $142 million) is reflected in collaboration profit sharing. Fourth quarter and full year 2021 GAAP and Non-GAAP cost of sales includes approximately $165 million and $170 million, respectively, in charges associated with the
    

      2
    




      write-off of inventory and purchase commitments in excess of forecasted demand related to ADUHELM. Eisai's share of these charges (approximately $82 million and $84 million, respectively) is reflected in collaboration profit sharing.
    




      •Fourth quarter 2021 GAAP and Non-GAAP R&D expense includes a $60 million opt-in payment to Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to obtain exclusive rights to develop and commercialize BIIB115, a preclinical investigational antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and approximately $50 million related to the exercise of our option to participate in a profit-sharing arrangement with Genentech, Inc. for the development and commercialization of mosunetuzumab (now approved in the U.S. as LUNSUMIOTM), a late-stage bispecific antibody in development for B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and other therapeutic areas.
    




      •Full year 2021 GAAP and Non-GAAP R&D expense includes a total of $285 million in payments related to our collaborations with InnoCare Pharma Limited, Ionis, Bio-Thera Solutions, Ltd., Genentech, Capsigen Inc., and Ginkgo Bioworks, as well as $39 million of estimated clinical trial close-out costs and manufacturing commitments due to suspended development of BIIB111 in choroideremia and BIIB112 in X-linked retinitis pigmentosa.
    




      •The decrease in fourth quarter and full year 2022 GAAP and Non-GAAP SG&A expense was driven primarily by cost savings initiatives.
    

      Other Financial Highlights
    




      •In the fourth quarter of 2022, Biogen discontinued further development of vixotrigine (BIIB074) for the treatment of neuropathic pain, resulting in a GAAP impairment charge of approximately $120 million. In addition, this decision resulted in a GAAP pre-tax gain of approximately $195 million due to an adjustment to the value of contingent consideration obligations related to vixotrigine.
    




      •Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP and Non-GAAP collaboration profit sharing was a net expense of $35 million, which includes $46 million of net profit sharing expense related to Biogen's collaboration with Samsung Bioepis, partially offset by reimbursement of $11 million from Eisai related to ADUHELM in the U.S. Full year 2022 GAAP and Non-GAAP collaboration profit sharing reduced our net operating expense by $7 million, which includes reimbursement of $225 million from Eisai related to ADUHELM in the U.S., partially offset by $217 million of net profit sharing expense related to Biogen's collaboration with Samsung Bioepis.
    




      •Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP other expense was $113 million, primarily driven by net unrealized losses on strategic equity investments of $107 million. Fourth quarter 2022 Non-GAAP other expense was $7 million, primarily driven by net interest expense. Full year 2022 GAAP other income was $108 million, driven by a realized gain of $1,505 million related to the sale of equity interest in Samsung Bioepis, partially offset by net unrealized losses on strategic equity investments of $265 million, net interest expense of $157 million, and an expense of $917 million related to the previously disclosed litigation settlement. Full year 2022 Non-GAAP other expense was $213 million, primarily driven by net interest expense.
    




      •Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP and Non-GAAP effective tax rates were 9% and 15%, respectively. The fourth quarter 2022 effective GAAP tax rate benefited from the decision to discontinue development of vixotrigine and the resulting impairment and adjustment to contingent consideration as well as mark-to-market losses on our marketable equity securities portfolio. Full year 2022 GAAP and Non-GAAP effective tax rates were 18% and 15%, respectively. The full year 2022 GAAP effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by a valuation allowance recorded on Neurimmune's tax basis in ADUHELM as well as the non-deductible portion of the previously disclosed litigation settlement, partially offset by the deferred tax benefits of an international restructuring.

      Financial Position
    




      •Fourth quarter 2022 net cash outflow from operations was $175 million, which includes a payment of approximately $917 million related to the previously disclosed litigation settlement. Capital expenditures were $86 million, and free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, was a net cash outflow of $261 million.
    




      •Full year 2022 cash flow from operations was $1,384 million, which also includes the payment of approximately $917 million related to the previously disclosed litigation settlement. Capital expenditures were $240 million, and free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, was $1,144 million.
    




      •As of December 31, 2022, Biogen had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $5,598 million and $6,281 million in total debt, resulting in net debt of $683 million.
    




      •Throughout 2022 Biogen repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares of the Company's common stock for a total value of $750 million. No shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2022, there was $2,050 million remaining under the share repurchase program authorized in October 2020.
    




      •For the fourth quarter of 2022 the Company's weighted average diluted shares were 145 million. For 2022 the Company's full year weighted average diluted shares were 146 million.
    




      Full Year 2023 Financial Guidance
    




      For the full year 2023, Biogen expects revenue and Non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance ranges as follows:
    








            Full Year 2023
          



            Total revenue
          

            Mid-single digit percentage decline versus reported full year 2022
          



            Non-GAAP diluted EPS
          

            $15.00 to $16.00
          







      This guidance assumes a favorable decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union relating to regulatory data protection for TECFIDERA, which is currently expected on March 16, 2023, although Biogen cannot predict the outcome.
    




      Biogen expects modest in-market revenue for LEQEMBITM in 2023 with commercialization expenses exceeding revenue. Biogen will record its share of net commercial profits and losses for LEQEMBI in the U.S. as a component of total revenue, which is expected to be a headwind to revenue in 2023.
    




      This guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2022, will remain in effect for the remainder of the year, net of hedging activities.
    




      This financial guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions or pending and future litigation, as all are hard to predict, or any impact of potential tax or healthcare reform. Biogen may incur charges, realize gains or losses, or experience other events or circumstances in 2023 that could cause any of these assumptions to change and/or actual results to vary from this financial guidance.
    




      Biogen does not provide guidance for GAAP reported financial measures (other than revenue) or a reconciliation of forward-looking Non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP reported financial measures because the Company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the financial impact of items such as the transaction, integration, and certain other costs related to acquisitions or large business development transactions; unusual gains and losses; potential future asset impairments; gains and losses from our equity security investments; and the ultimate outcome of pending significant litigation without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors,
    

      4
    




      and could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the guidance period. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.

      We supplement our GAAP consolidated financial statements and GAAP financial measures with other financial measures, such as adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, revenue growth at constant currency, which excludes the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and hedging gains or losses, and free cash flow, which is defined as net cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. We believe that these and other Non-GAAP financial measures provide additional insight into the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage our business internally, set operational goals and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

      Notes to GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation
    

      A Amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021, decreased primarily due to higher impairment charges recognized during 2021.
    

      For the year ended December 31, 2022, amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets reflects the impact of a $119.6 million impairment charge related to vixotrigine (BIIB074) for the potential treatment of diabetic painful neuropathy (DPN). During the fourth quarter of 2022 we discontinued further development of vixotrigine based on regulatory, development and commercialization challenges. We also adjusted the value of our contingent consideration obligations related to this asset resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $209.1 million, which was recognized in (gain) loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration within our consolidated statements of income.
    

      For the year ended December 31, 2021, amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets reflects the impact of a $365.0 million impairment charge related to BIIB111, a $220.0 million impairment charge related to BIIB112 and a $44.3 million impairment charge related to vixotrigine for the potential treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (TGN).
    




      BIn April 2022 we completed the sale of our 49.9% equity interest in Samsung Bioepis to Samsung BioLogics Co., Ltd (Samsung BioLogics). Under the terms of this transaction, we received approximately $1.0 billion in cash at closing and expect to receive approximately $1.3 billion in cash to be deferred over two payments of approximately $812.5 million due at the first anniversary and approximately $437.5 million due at the second anniversary of the closing of this transaction.
    

      For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.5 billion related to this transaction, which was recorded in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income.
    




      C During the second quarter of 2022 we recorded a pre-tax charge of $900.0 million, plus settlement fees and expenses, related to a litigation settlement agreement to resolve a qui tam litigation relating to conduct prior to 2015.
    




      DIn July 2022 we redeemed our 3.625% Senior Notes prior to their maturity and recognized a net pre-tax charge of approximately $2.4 million upon the extinguishment of these Senior Notes, which primarily reflects the payment of an early call premium as well as the write-off of remaining unamortized original debt issuance costs and discount balances. These charges were recognized as interest expense in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022.
    




      E For the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021, the increase in our effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the net Neurimmune deferred tax asset, as discussed below, includes the tax impacts of the litigation settlement agreement and the sale of our building at 125 Broadway. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the current year tax benefits related to an international reorganization to align with global tax developments, the impacts of the sale of our equity interest in Samsung Bioepis and the tax impacts of the decision to discontinue development of vixotrigine. Further in 2021, our effective tax rate benefited from the tax effects of the BIIB111 and BIIB112 impairment charges and the non-cash tax effects of changes in the value of our equity instruments.
    

      During 2021 we recorded a net deferred tax asset in Switzerland of approximately $100.0 million on Neurimmune's tax basis in ADUHELM, the realization of which was dependent on future sales of ADUHELM.
    

      During the first quarter of 2022, upon issuance of the final NCD related to ADUHELM, we recorded an increase in a valuation allowance of approximately $85.0 million to reduce the net value of this deferred tax asset to zero. These adjustments to our net deferred tax asset are each recorded with an equal and offsetting amount assigned to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statements of income, resulting in a zero net impact to net income attributable to Biogen Inc.
    




      F In September 2022 we completed the sale of our building and land parcel located at 125 Broadway for an aggregate sales price of approximately $603.0 million, which is inclusive of a $10.8 million tenant allowance. This sale resulted in a pre-tax gain on sale of approximately $503.7 million, net of transaction costs, which is reflected within gain on sale of building in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022.

      Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
    

      We supplement our GAAP consolidated financial statements and GAAP financial measures with other financial measures, such as adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, revenue growth at constant currency, which excludes the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and hedging gains or losses, and free cash flow, which is defined as net cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. We believe that these and other Non-GAAP financial measures provide additional insight into the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage our business internally, set operational goals and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
    

      Our "Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Inc." and "Non-GAAP earnings per share - Diluted" financial measures exclude the following items from "GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Inc." and "GAAP earnings per share - Diluted":
    

      1. Acquisitions and divestitures
    

      We exclude transaction, integration and certain other costs related to the acquisition and divestiture of businesses and items associated with the initial consolidation or deconsolidation of variable interest entities. These adjustments include, but are not limited to, the amortization and impairment of intangible assets, charges or credits from the fair value remeasurement of our contingent consideration obligations and losses on assets and liabilities held for sale.
    

      2. Restructuring, business transformation and other cost saving initiatives
    

      We exclude costs associated with our execution of certain strategies and initiatives to streamline operations, achieve targeted cost reductions, rationalize manufacturing facilities or refocus research and development activities. These costs may include employee separation costs, retention bonuses, facility closing and exit costs, asset impairment charges or additional depreciation when the expected useful life of certain assets have been shortened due to changes in anticipated usage and other costs or credits that management believes do not have a direct correlation to our ongoing or future business operations.
    

      3. (Gain) loss on equity security investments
    

      We exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses related to our equity security investments as we do not believe that these components of income or expense have a direct correlation to our ongoing or future business operations.
    

      4. Other items
    

      We evaluate other items of income and expense on an individual basis and consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. We also include an adjustment to reflect the related tax effect of all reconciling items within our reconciliation of our GAAP to Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Inc. and earnings per share - diluted.
