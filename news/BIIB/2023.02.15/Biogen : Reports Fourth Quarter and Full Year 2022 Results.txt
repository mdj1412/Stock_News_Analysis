Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP and Non-GAAP cost of sales includes approximately $36 million of idle capacity charges. Eisai Co., Ltd.'s (Eisai) share of these charges (approximately $18 million) is reflected in collaboration profit sharing. Full year 2022 GAAP and Non-GAAP cost of sales includes approximately $119 million of idle capacity charges. Eisai's share of these charges (approximately $55 million) is reflected in collaboration profit sharing.
        

Full year 2022 GAAP and Non-GAAP cost of sales includes approximately $286 million in charges associated with the write-off of inventory and purchase commitments in excess of forecasted demand related to ADUHELM. Eisai's share of these charges (approximately $142 million) is reflected in collaboration profit sharing. Fourth quarter and full year 2021 GAAP and Non-GAAP cost of sales includes approximately $165 million and $170 million, respectively, in charges associated with the write-off of inventory and purchase commitments in excess of forecasted demand related to
          ADUHELM. Eisai's share of these charges (approximately $82 million and $84 million, respectively) is reflected in collaboration profit sharing.
        

Fourth quarter 2021 GAAP and Non-GAAP R&D expense includes a $60 million opt-in payment to Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to obtain exclusive rights to develop and commercialize BIIB115, a preclinical investigational antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and approximately $50 million related to the exercise of our option to participate in a profit-sharing arrangement with Genentech, Inc. for the development and commercialization of mosunetuzumab (now approved in the U.S. as LUNSUMIOTM), a late-stage bispecific antibody in development for B-cellnon-Hodgkin's lymphoma and other therapeutic areas.
        

Full year 2021 GAAP and Non-GAAP R&D expense includes a total of $285 million in payments related to our collaborations with InnoCare Pharma Limited, Ionis, Bio-Thera Solutions, Ltd., Genentech, Capsigen Inc., and Ginkgo Bioworks, as well as $39 million of estimated clinical trial close-out costs and manufacturing commitments due to suspended development of BIIB111 in choroideremia and BIIB112 in X-linked retinitis pigmentosa.
        

The decrease in fourth quarter and full year 2022 GAAP and Non-GAAP SG&A expense was driven primarily by cost savings initiatives.
        


        Other Financial Highlights
      


In the fourth quarter of 2022, Biogen discontinued further development of vixotrigine (BIIB074) for the treatment of neuropathic pain, resulting in a GAAP impairment charge of approximately $120 million. In addition, this decision resulted in a GAAP pre-tax gain of approximately $195 million due to an adjustment to the value of contingent consideration obligations related to vixotrigine.
        

Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP and Non-GAAP collaboration profit sharing was a net expense of $35 million, which includes $46 million of net profit sharing expense related to Biogen's collaboration with
          Samsung Bioepis, partially offset by reimbursement of $11 million from Eisai related to ADUHELM in the U.S. Full year 2022 GAAP and Non-GAAP collaboration profit sharing reduced our net operating expense by $7 million, which includes reimbursement of $225 million from Eisai related to ADUHELM in the U.S., partially offset by $217 million of net profit sharing expense related to Biogen's collaboration with Samsung Bioepis.

Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP other expense was $113 million, primarily driven by net unrealized losses on strategic equity investments of $107 million. Fourth quarter 2022 Non-GAAP other expense was $7 million, primarily driven by net interest expense. Full year 2022 GAAP other income was $108 million, driven by a realized gain of $1,505 million related to the sale of equity interest in Samsung Bioepis, partially offset by net unrealized losses on strategic equity investments of $265 million, net interest expense of $157 million, and an expense of $917 million related to the previously disclosed litigation settlement. Full year 2022 Non-GAAP other expense was $213 million, primarily driven by net interest expense.
        

Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP and Non-GAAP effective tax rates were 9% and 15%, respectively. The fourth quarter 2022 effective GAAP tax rate benefited from the decision to discontinue development of vixotrigine and the resulting impairment and adjustment to contingent consideration as well as mark-to-market losses on our marketable equity securities portfolio. Full year 2022 GAAP and Non- GAAP effective tax rates were 18% and 15%, respectively. The full year 2022 GAAP effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by a valuation allowance recorded on Neurimmune's tax basis in ADUHELM as well as the non-deductible portion of the previously disclosed litigation settlement, partially offset by the deferred tax benefits of an international restructuring.

        Full Year 2023 Financial Guidance
      

        For the full year 2023, Biogen expects revenue and Non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance ranges as follows:
      






              Full Year 2023
            





              Total revenue
            



              Mid-single digit percentage decline versus
            







              reported full year 2022
            





              Non-GAAP diluted EPS
            



              $15.00 to $16.00
            




        This guidance assumes a favorable decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union relating to regulatory data protection for TECFIDERA, which is currently expected on March 16, 2023, although Biogen cannot predict the outcome.
      

        Biogen expects modest in-market revenue for LEQEMBITM in 2023 with commercialization expenses exceeding revenue. Biogen will record its share of net commercial profits and losses for LEQEMBI in the U.S. as a component of total revenue, which is expected to be a headwind to revenue in 2023.
      

        This guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2022, will remain in effect for the remainder of the year, net of hedging activities.
      

        This financial guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions or pending and future litigation, as all are hard to predict, or any impact of potential tax or healthcare reform. Biogen may incur charges, realize gains or losses, or experience other events or circumstances in 2023 that could cause any of these assumptions to change and/or actual results to vary from this financial guidance.
      

        Biogen does not provide guidance for GAAP reported financial measures (other than revenue) or a reconciliation of forward-lookingNon-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP reported financial measures because the Company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the financial impact of items such as the transaction, integration, and certain other costs related to acquisitions or large business development transactions; unusual gains and losses; potential future asset impairments; gains and losses from our equity security investments; and the ultimate outcome of pending significant litigation without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the guidance period. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.
      

        Recent Developments
      


In the fourth quarter of 2022 Biogen initiated a Phase 2 Study of BIIB080 (anti-tau ASO) in early
          Alzheimer's disease.
        

In the fourth quarter of 2022 Biogen initiated the Phase 1 Study of BIIB115, an ASO in development for SMA that may have the potential to help address additional unmet needs of patients as well as to be administered at extended dosing intervals.
