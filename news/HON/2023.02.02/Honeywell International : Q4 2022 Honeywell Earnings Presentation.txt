          Forward Looking Statements
        

          This presentation contains certain statements that may be deemed "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All
        

          statements, other than statements of historical fact, that address activities, events, or developments that we or our management intends, expects, projects, believes, or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward looking statements. Such statements are based upon certain assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of their experience and their perception of historical trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments, and other factors they believe to be appropriate. The forward-looking statements included in this presentation are also subject to a number of material risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to economic, competitive, governmental, technological, COVID-19 public health factors or impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict affecting our operations, markets, products, services, and prices. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, and other developments, including the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and business decisions may differ from those envisaged by such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking plans described herein
        

          are not final and may be modified or abandoned at any time. We identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K and other filings with
        

          the Securities and Exchange Commission.
        

          Non-GAAP Financial Measures
        

          This presentation contains financial measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Honeywell's non-GAAP financial measures used in this presentation are as follows: Segment profit, on an overall Honeywell basis, a measure by which we assess operating performance, which we define as operating income adjusted for certain items as presented in the
        

          Appendix; Segment margin, on an overall Honeywell basis; Organic sales growth; Free cash flow; Free cash flow excluding the Impact of Settlements; Free cash flow margin;
        

          Adjusted earnings per share; Adjusted earnings per share excluding pension headwind; Adjusted income before taxes; Adjusted tax expense; and Adjusted effective tax rate, if and as noted in the presentation. Management believes that, when considered together with reported amounts, these measures are useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as replacements for, the most comparable GAAP measure. Certain measures presented on a non-GAAP basis represent the impact of adjusting items net of tax. The tax-effect for adjusting items is determined individually and on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Appendix attached to this presentation for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

            Background and Key Details
          


Honeywell's predecessor, Allied Corporation, owned NARCO from 1979 to 1986, at which time Allied Corporation sold NARCO and entered into a cross-indemnityagreement for asbestos-relatedclaims


Honeywell established its initial liability for NARCO asbestos claims in 2002
            

The NARCO Trust was established in 2013 upon NARCO emerging from bankruptcy, with HarbisonWalker International (HWI) becoming the reorganized and renamed entity


Honeywell retained evergreen funding obligation - a ~$700M existing liability plus ongoing expenses to operate the Trust and manage legal disputes


Entered into a buyout agreement with the NARCO Trust regarding Honeywell's legacy asbestos liabilities which received final court approval in December 2022
            

Cash payment was made to the Trust in the January 2023, providing a one-timeheadwind of ($1.3B) to free cash flow that will be partially offset by a $295M1 benefit for
              Honeywell's rights to the net proceeds from the sale of HWI to be completed later in 2023
            

Key benefits for Honeywell:




Eliminates evergreen funding obligation


Removes future quarterly asbestos charges related to NARCO


Further enhances the quality of the balance sheet


De-risksfuture unpredictability
