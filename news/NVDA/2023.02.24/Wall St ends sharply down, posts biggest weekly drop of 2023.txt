of 2023 after sharp losses on Friday, as investors braced for
the possibility of more aggressive rate hikes from the U.S.
Federal Reserve as U.S. economic data pointed to resilient
consumers.For the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average, the
3% fall was its biggest weekly decline since September. It was
also the Dow's fourth straight weekly decline, its longest
losing streak for nearly 10 months.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were
also down 2.7% and 3.3%, respectively.After a strong January, stocks have retreated this month as
a slew of economic data amplified worries that the U.S. central
bank might have to keep rates higher for longer.Data on Friday showed the personal consumption expenditures
(PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, shot up
0.6% last month after gaining just 0.2% in December. Consumer
spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S.
economic activity, jumped 1.8% last month, exceeding forecasts
for a 1.3% rise.Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth
at Glenmede, said previous market cycles had witnessed similar
delayed reactions by the market to rising interest rates and
data releases, which helps explain volatile trading patterns as
investors slowly adjust."This market has not yet realized the likelihood of a
recession that we think is reality," he said, noting past rate
hikes normally had taken between six and 18 months before their
effects had fully filtered through into the economy."We don't think (a recession is) a given, but there's a
higher likelihood than the market has embedded in its thought
process."Traders of futures tied to the Fed's policy rate added to
bets of at least three more rate hikes this year, with the peak
rate seen in the range of 5.25%-5.5% by June.Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said the Fed should
raise interest rates higher than necessary if need be to get
inflation fully under control.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 336.99 points,
