were reassured by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen'sreassurancesthat measures will be taken to keep Americans' deposits
safe.All three major U.S. stock indexes reversed an earlier
rally, turning red before clawing their way back to positive
territory in the final hour as Yellen resumed her congressional
testimony.Dropping Treasury yields, particularly an 18 basis point
drop in two-year note yields, helped growth shares boost the
Nasdaq to the head of the pack."You watch this market and you watch it change direction in
a short period of time and it’s based on some market
participants’ interpretation over what someone said and how it
affects how their trading," said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio
manager at GLOBALT Investments in Atlanta."The market as a whole is telling you is there are a lot of
different ways to interpret all the things people are saying."The session followed Wednesday's boom-and-bust moves after
the Fed's rate hike, Fed Chair Jerome Powell's subsequent Q&A
session and Yellen's testimony before Congress in which she
ruled out blanket protection for all deposits.Interest rate hikes by central banks around the world have
stressed the banking sector, which became manifest with the
recent failures of SVB Financial Group and Signature
Bank.Jitters among regional banks persist, with the KBW Regional
Bank index sliding 3.0%.The S&P 500 banks index dipped 1.2% to its
lowest level since November 2020, and it has now fallen over 40%
from its record high in February 2022.Comments from the Bank of England that inflation will
probably quickly fade also helped fuel hopes of light at the end
of the central bank tightening tunnel."Every central bank that was on path to raise rates raised
them," GLOBALT's Martin added. "Therefore they’ve all identified
that inflation is currently the most important issue and poses
the most risk to the system, whereas the effect of higher rates
on financial stability isn’t as much of a concern - although it
remains highly concerning."The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 75.14 points,
or 0.23%, to 32,105.25, the S&P 500 gained 11.75 points,
or 0.30%, to 3,948.72 and the Nasdaq Composite added
117.44 points, or 1.01%, to 11,787.40.Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, only
communication services and tech ended the
session higher.First Republic Bankdropped6.0% in volatile trading in the wake of Yellen's testimony.Chipmaker Nvidia Corp advanced2.7% after Needhamraisedits price target.Block Inc shares slid14.8% after Hindenburg Research disclosed itsshort positionsin the company.Crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc dropped14.1% in the wake of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission'sthreat to suethe company.Accenture surged7.3% after it announcedplansto cut about 2.5% of its workforce.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE
by a 1.59-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.12-to-1 ratio favored
decliners.The S&P 500 posted four new 52-week highs and 32 new
lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 51 new highs and 296 new
lows.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.35 billion shares,
compared with the 12.80 billion average over the last 20 trading
days.
