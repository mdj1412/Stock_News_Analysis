OAKLAND, Calif., Feb 23 (Reuters) - Tel Aviv-based
blockchain chip startup Chain Reaction on Thursday said it
raised $70 million which will be used to expand its engineering
team as it develops its next chip and rolls out its first one to
the market this year.Alon Webman, co-founder and CEO of Chain Reaction, told
Reuters that the company will start mass producing its
blockchain chip Electrum in the first quarter this year. He said
the chip is designed to carry out blockchain operations called
"hashing" very fast and power efficiently and also can be used
for mining digital currencies like bitcoin.Webman said he was confident the company could gain market
share in the blockchain chip segment which he expects will
support its more ambitious goal of creating a so-called "fully
homomorphic encryption" chip that allows users to work on data
while it's encrypted.He aims to launch that chip as early as end-2024.He said many industries such as defence and governments
can't completely move to the cloud due to security issues.
"Today if you have data (which) is encrypted into the cloud and
in order to do any data operation or data analytics, do A.I.,
you have to decrypt the data," said Webman. "The moment the data
is decrypted, it can be attacked by a malicious user to read it,
to steal it, or even to change it."Webman said he has been involved in designing over 30 chips.
He is the co-founder of Mellanox Technologies Ltd., a datacenter
networking chip company that U.S. chip supplier Nvidia Corp
bought for nearly $7 billion in 2020.The latest funding round was led by Morgan Creek Digital, a
venture capital firm specializing in blockchain technology, AI,
and digital assets, and brings the total raised to $115 million.
