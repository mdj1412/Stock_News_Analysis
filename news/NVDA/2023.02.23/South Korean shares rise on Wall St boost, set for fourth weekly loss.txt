financial markets:** South Korean shares rose on Friday, helped by Wall

caution ahead of U.S. inflation data. The Korean won weakened,

to 2,448.90 as of 0059 GMT.** For the week so far, the index is down 0.1% and is set
for a fourth straight weekly loss.** "The index traded in a narrow range, having already
priced in the Nvidia boost a day before, and also under the
caution over U.S. inflation data," said Seo Sang-young, an
analyst at Mirae Asset Securities.** U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index,
due for release later in the day, is expected to show a slower
annual increase for January.** Nvidia reported a surge in the use of its chips
to power artificial intelligence services. Local chipmakers had
rallied on the news on Thursday, ahead of its 14% jump
overnight.** Technology giant Samsung Electronics rose
0.48%, peer SK Hynix gained 0.54%, and battery maker
LG Energy Solution climbed 1.97%.** Including the market heavyweights, only 338 shares
advanced among 932 traded issues.** Foreigners were net buyers of shares worth 38.3 billion
won ($29.51 million).** The won was quoted at 1,298.8 per dollar on the onshore
settlement platform, down 0.13%.** In money and debt markets, March futures on three-year
treasury bonds rose 0.11 point to 103.86.** The most liquid three-year Korean treasury bond yield
fell by 2.4 basis points to 3.570%, while the benchmark 10-year
yield fell by 3.3 basis points to 3.555%.
