*Chipmaker Nvidia beats expectations, shares jump 9%*MSCI AxJ index +0.7%; S&P 500 futures +0.5%*BOK pauses year-long run of hikesSINGAPORE, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Asian stock markets eked
gains on Thursday after better-than-expected revenue at chip
giant Nvidia helped the sector in Taiwan and South Korea and
offset worries that strong economic data so far this year is a
harbinger of even more rate hikes.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
touched its lowest level since Jan. 6 in early
trade, but rose about 0.7% as the day wore on.Nasdaq futures rose 0.9% thanks to Nvidia's revenue
beat and rosy outlook which sent its shares up nearly
9% after-hours.Shares in the giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co
rose 2.2% to lift Taiwan's benchmark 1.3%. A
4% gain for SK Hynix and a 2% gain for Samsung
drove South Korea's Kospi 1% higher.Currencies in South Korea and Taiwan
each rose sharply."The semiconductor sector has been troubled, but signs of
recovery are picking up," said Kiyong Seong, lead Asia macro
strategist at Societe Generale in Hong Kong. "Markets have
positioned for a recovery in the second half of this year so
anything supportive of that is helpful for prices."The Bank of Korea also offered some relief by ending a
year-long run of uninterrupted rate hikes with a pause - as
expected.Currency trade was lightened by a holiday in Japan but the
drift was in line with the broader mood - sending the dollar
down a little bit in favour of riskier currencies.The Australian and New Zealand dollars each bounced about
0.5% on the dollar, pushing the Aussie to $0.6842 and
the kiwi to $0.6251. The euro hovered around
$1.0622 and the yen traded at 134.77 to the dollar.The Singapore dollar fell slightly after inflation
accelerated a little slower than expected.The resumption of Japan trade on Friday could be bumpy as
Japanese CPI data is due and investors - who are speculating
that a policy shift is nigh - will be positioning ahead of a
parliament appearance by incoming central bank governor Kazuo
Ueda. Treasuries were untraded owing to Thursday's holiday.HIGHER FOR LONGERSignals elsewhere were less reassuring as this year's run of
strong economic data has investors worrying interest rates will
need to keep rising and stay high to put the brakes on
inflation.Oil nursed sharp Wednesday losses, and Brent crude futures
clung to support around $80 a barrel on Thursday.Results season drove stock movements in Australia. Flag
carrier Qantas Airways posted a record first-half
profit but shares suffered their biggest drop in a year - down
7.3% - after the company warned fares would probably fall.Wall Street indexes fell overnight and are eyeing their
worst week of the year so far as stronger-than-forecast U.S.
labour, inflation, retail sales and manufacturing figures have
traders pricing interest rates staying higher for longer.Minutes from this month's Federal Reserve meeting -
reinforcing a hawkish tone - did little to shift the concern."Markets have been forced to reprice interest rate
expectations, not just higher, but also questioning the view
that once peak rates are hit, central banks will pivot quickly
to cutting interest rates," said ANZ economist Finn Robinson."Economic resilience is to be lauded," he said."But central banks are uncomfortable with current levels of
aggregate expenditure and labour market demand ... if the
upcoming run of February data for the U.S. confirm robust
economic activity, it is difficult to see how risk will recover
in the near term."Gold steadied at $1,825 an ounce.Final European inflation and U.S. growth figures are due
later in the day, though no major tweaks to preliminary numbers
are expected. Fed officials Mary Daly and Raphael Bostic are
also due to make appearances later on Thursday.(Reporting by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Stephen Coates)
