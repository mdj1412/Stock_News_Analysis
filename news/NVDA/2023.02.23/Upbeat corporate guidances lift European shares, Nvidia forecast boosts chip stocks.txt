Thursday, after two straight sessions of declines, supported by
financial stocks and upbeat guidance by regional companies,
while U.S. semiconductor designer Nvidia's positive sales
forecast sparked a rally in chip stocks.The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.1%.AXArose 3.2% after the French insurer raised its
2023 guidance and announced a share buy-back programme, while
posting lower-than-expected full-year earnings.Banks gained 0.9%, while insurers added
0.3%.Also aiding sentiment, data earlier in the day showed
that euro zone inflation was only atouch higherthan earlier estimated in January, confirming that price
growth is now well past its peak.The rate-sensitive technology sector rose 0.4%,
supported by a jump in semiconductor stocks.Chipmakers ASM International, BE Semiconductor
and Aixtron gained between 0.4% and 1.2%.U.S. peer Nvidia Corp forecast first-quarter
revenue above Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, noting a
strong boost from the use of its chips in artificial
intelligence (AI) services such as chatbots.The shorter-term demand for chips will get a boost to fuel
"an AI gold rush, if you think such a phenomenon will actually
materialize," said Greg Bassuk, chief executive at AXS
Investments.However, the worries of central banks raising interest rates
for longer still lingered.The minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's last policy
meeting released on Wednesday showed nearly all policymakers
rallied behind a decision to further slow the pace of interest
rate hikes, noting inflation would determine how much further
rates needed to rise."The starkest takeaway was, arguably, that some policymakers
could have gotten behind another 50 basis point increase and all
backed further tightening ahead," said Craig Erlam, senior
market analyst at OANDA.Recent data showed French and German economic activity moved
into growth territory, while a rebound in U.S. business activity
also backed views that interest rates in both economies will
remain higher for longer.Still, the STOXX 600 has risen nearly 9% so far this year,
more than double the S&P 500 index's 3.9% rise.Europe has benefited from better weather, hopes that the
economy will narrowly avoid a recession and a boost from China's
reopening.Engineering firm Rolls-Royce surged 23.7%, to the top
of the STOXX 600, after the company's CEO forecast more profit
growth in 2023 after last year's profit beat expectations.Auto stocks rose 1.0%, with carmaker Stellantis
up 3.6%.Media stocks were up 0.3%, boosted by a 3.4% rise in
British ad group WPP after it forecast
better-than-expected organic growth of 3% to 5% for the year.UK banks and healthcare majors fell, weighing on the FTSE
100 index. Barclays, Standard Chartered
, AstraZeneca and GSK fell as they
traded without an entitlement for dividend payout.
