*Chipmaker Nvidia beats expectations, shares jump 9%*Nvidia news sends Nasdaq futures higher*Crude oil edges up after string of lossesLONDON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Global shares eked out slim
gains on Thursday as strong earnings in the semiconductor sector
were overshadowed by news that the Federal Reserve would
continue on its path of raising rates to quell inflation, but by
taking smaller steps.The dollar steadied, while oil edged up as WTI crude
dug in its heels after a six-day lBetter-than-expected revenue at chip giant Nvidia
after hours sent its shares up 9% on Wall Street, helping to
push Nasdaq futures 0.9% higher on Thursday, along with
shares in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, and
European peers such as ASM International and BE
Semiconductor.The MSCI all country share index was
slightly firmer, adding to the year's 4.5% advance, after
falling nearly 20% in 2022."I think the market is pricing in a slightly more aggressive
Fed tightening than perhaps was going to be the consensus, but I
don't think it's going to change that much," said Mike Hewson,
chief markets strategist at CMC Markets.In Europe, the STOXX index of leading European
companies was 0.2% firmer, building on its 8.8% gain for the
year to nearly wiping out much of last year's 13% loss.Nearly all Fed policymakers backed further slowing the pace
of rate hikes, minutes of the U.S. central bank's last
policy meeting showed on Wednesday, but it also indicated that
curbing unacceptably high inflation would be the "key factor" in
how much further rates need to rise.Analysts say the early-year rally in stocks has succumbed to
a realisation that the Fed will continue to increase interest
rates to cool the economy and tame inflation.This has pushed safe-haven bond yields higher, making risky
stocks less attractive, with the Fed's next meeting nearly a
month away on March 22.The yield on 10-year Treasury was slightly
firmer at 3.9254%.Eren Osman, managing director of wealth management at
Arbuthnot Latham & Co, said bond yields were starting to price
in a higher terminal rate of 5.5% rather than 5.25% for the Fed."From the minutes of the Fed, I take out of it a bonus that
they appear to be more balanced in their inflation outlook, they
recognise risks to the economy are skewed to the downside,"
Osman said."The idea that we see rate cuts later in the year are quite
rightly being discounted to a greater extent," Osman said. "In
the absence of a clear reversal in the current easing of
inflation, we feel comfortable that yields have kind of topped
out within this cycle."Analysts said markets were bracing for a "no landing"
scenario where global economic growth is resilient and inflation
stays higher for longer, leading investors to dial back appetite
for risk assets and government debt.MORE DATA DUEMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
touched its lowest level since Jan. 6 in early

year-long run of uninterrupted rate hikes with a pause, as
expected.The Australian and New Zealand dollar were
both slightly firmer against the dollar.The euro was little changed at $1.060. The dollar
pegged against a basket of currencies reversed losses to
