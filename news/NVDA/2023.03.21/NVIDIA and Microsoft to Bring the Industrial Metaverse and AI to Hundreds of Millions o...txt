SANTA CLARA, Calif., March  21, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC -- NVIDIA today announced a collaboration with Microsoft to provide hundreds of millions of Microsoft enterprise users with access to powerful industrial metaverse and AI supercomputing resources via the cloud.Microsoft Azure will host two new cloud offerings from NVIDIA: NVIDIA Omniverse™ Cloud, a platform-as-a-service giving instant access to a full-stack environment to design, develop, deploy and manage industrial metaverse applications; and NVIDIA DGX™ Cloud, an AI supercomputing service that gives enterprises immediate access to the infrastructure and software needed to train advanced models for generative AI and other groundbreaking applications.Additionally, the companies are bringing together their productivity and 3D collaboration platforms by connecting Microsoft 365 applications — such as Teams, OneDrive and SharePoint — with NVIDIA Omniverse™, a platform for building and operating 3D industrial metaverse applications.The collaboration will accelerate enterprises’ ability to digitalize their operations, engage in the industrial metaverse and train advanced models for generative AI and other applications.“The world’s largest companies are racing to digitalize every aspect of their business and reinvent themselves into software-defined technology companies,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “NVIDIA AI and Omniverse supercharge industrial digitalization. Building NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud within Microsoft Azure brings customers the best of our combined capabilities.”“The next wave of computing is being born, between next-generation immersive experiences and advanced foundational AI models, we see the emergence of a new computing platform,” said Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft. “Together with NVIDIA, we're focused on both building out services that bridge the digital and physical worlds to automate, simulate and predict every business process, and bringing the most powerful AI supercomputer to customers globally.”With Omniverse connected to Azure Cloud Services Digital Twins and Internet of Things, companies can link real-time data from sensors in the physical world to their digital replicas. This will enable enterprises to build and operate more accurate, dynamic, fully functional 3D digital twins that automatically respond to changes in their physical environments. Azure provides the cloud infrastructure and capabilities needed to deploy enterprise services at scale, including security, identity and storage.A GTC keynote demo developed by Accenture amplifies the utility of integrating NVIDIA Omniverse with Microsoft Teams to enable real-time 3D collaboration. Running on Omniverse Cloud, and leveraging a Teams Meeting featuring Live Share, the Accenture demo showcases how this integration can shorten the time between decision-making, action and feedback.Omniverse Cloud, powered by NVIDIA OVX™ computing systems, will be available on Azure in the second half of the year.DGX Cloud will be available running in Azure beginning next quarter, providing enterprises with dedicated clusters of NVIDIA DGX AI supercomputing and software, rented on a monthly basis.Learn more about the collaboration and watch the GTC keynote.
