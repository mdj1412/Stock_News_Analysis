SANTA CLARA, Calif., March  21, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC -- NVIDIA today announced that Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) has selected the NVIDIA BlueField-3® DPU as the latest addition to its networking stack, offering OCI customers a powerful new option for offloading data center tasks from CPUs.BlueField-3 is NVIDIA’s third-generation data processing unit that enables enterprises to build software-defined, hardware-accelerated IT infrastructures from cloud to data center to edge. It improves performance, efficiency and security in data centers by offloading, accelerating and isolating infrastructure workloads, thus freeing expensive CPU cores to run business applications.OCI offers a wide range of cloud infrastructure and platform services to its customers to build and run applications and services in the cloud or on premises. By utilizing BlueField-3, OCI is extending its long-established approach of offloading data center infrastructure tasks from CPUs.“The age of AI demands cloud data center infrastructures to support extraordinary computing requirements,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “NVIDIA’s BlueField-3 DPU enables this advance, transforming traditional cloud computing environments into accelerated, energy-efficient and secure infrastructure to process the demanding workloads of generative AI.”“Oracle Cloud Infrastructure offers enterprise customers nearly unparalleled accessibility to AI and scientific computing infrastructure with the power to transform industries,” said Clay Magouyrk, executive vice president of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. “NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs are a key component of our strategy to provide state-of-the-art, sustainable cloud infrastructure with extreme performance.”BlueField-3 Boosts Data Center Performance, Efficiency and SecurityBlueField-3 is the foundation of the data center control plane that delivers cloud and AI services. Tests show power reductions of up to 24% on servers using NVIDIA BlueField DPUs compared to servers without DPUs.The DPUs support Ethernet and InfiniBand connectivity at up to 400 gigabits per second and provide 4x more compute power, up to 4x faster crypto acceleration, 2x faster storage processing and 4x more memory bandwidth compared to the previous generation of BlueField.BlueField also delivers full backward-compatibility through the NVIDIA DOCA™ software framework. DOCA equips developers with advanced, zero-trust security capabilities, including the ability to create metered cloud services that control resource access, validate each application and user, isolate potentially compromised machines and help protect data from breaches and theft.Watch Huang discuss the NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPU in his GTC keynote.About NVIDIASince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.
