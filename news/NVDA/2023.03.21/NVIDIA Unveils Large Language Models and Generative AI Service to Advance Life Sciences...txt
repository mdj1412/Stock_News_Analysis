SANTA CLARA, Calif., March  21, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC -- NVIDIA today announced an expanded set of generative AI cloud services for customizing AI foundation models to accelerate the creation of new proteins and therapeutics, as well as research in the fields of genomics, chemistry, biology and molecular dynamics.Part of NVIDIA AI Foundations, the new BioNeMo™ Cloud service offering — for both AI model training and inference — accelerates the most time-consuming and costly stages of drug discovery. It enables researchers to fine-tune generative AI applications on their own proprietary data, and to run AI model inference directly in a web browser or through new cloud application programming interfaces (APIs) that easily integrate into existing applications.“The transformative power of generative AI holds enormous promise for the life science and pharmaceutical industries,” said Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA. “NVIDIA’s long collaboration with pioneers in the field has led to the development of BioNeMo Cloud Service, which is already serving as an AI drug discovery laboratory. It provides pretrained models and allows customization of models with proprietary data that serve every stage of the drug-discovery pipeline, helping researchers identify the right target, design molecules and proteins, and predict their interactions in the body to develop the best drug candidate.”Amgen Among Early UsersAmgen, one of the world’s leading biotechnology companies, is already using the service to advance its research and development efforts.“BioNeMo is dramatically accelerating our approach to biologics discovery,” said Peter Grandsard, executive director of Biologics Therapeutic Discovery, Center for Research Acceleration by Digital Innovation at Amgen. “With it, we can pretrain large language models for molecular biology on Amgen’s proprietary data, enabling us to explore and develop therapeutic proteins for the next generation of medicine that will help patients.”Generative AI Supercharges Drug Discovery Pipeline BioNeMo Cloud service includes pretrained AI models to help researchers build AI pipelines for drug development. It has been adopted by drug-discovery companies including Evozyne and Insilico Medicine to support data-driven drug design for new therapeutic candidates.Generative AI models can rapidly identify potential drug molecules — in some cases designing compounds or protein-based therapeutics from scratch. Trained on large-scale datasets of small molecules, proteins, DNA and RNA sequences, these models can predict the 3D structure of a protein and how well a molecule will dock with a target protein.New Generative AI Models Available With BioNeMo Service Early AccessBioNeMo now has six new optimized, open-source models, in addition to its previously announced MegaMolBART generative chemistry model, ESM1nv protein language model and OpenFold protein structure prediction model. They include:The BioNeMo Service makes these generative AI models easily accessible through a browser-based interface for interactive inference and protein structure visualization. And by pairing BioNeMo with the supercomputing resources in NVIDIA DGX™ Cloud, researchers can customize their models on a fully managed software service using NVIDIA Base Command™ Platform and the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite.Pharma Companies, Startups Tap BioNeMo to Optimize AI WorkflowsPharmaceutical companies and drug discovery startups are using BioNeMo today and, in many cases, seeing significant results.Amgen pretrained and fine-tuned BioNeMo’s ESM model architecture using its own proprietary data on antibodies. It was able to slash the time it takes to train five custom models for molecule screening and optimization from three months to a few weeks on DGX Cloud.Researchers at Evozyne, a Chicago-based biotechnology company and member of the NVIDIA Inception program for cutting-edge startups, have collaborated with NVIDIA to develop a BioNeMo-based deep learning model called the Protein Transformer Variational AutoEncoder. The generative AI model, fine-tuned on Evozyne’s proprietary protein data, enables the design of synthetic variants with significantly improved performance compared to enzymes found in nature.Insilico Medicine, a premier member of NVIDIA Inception, is using BioNeMo to accelerate the early drug discovery process, which traditionally takes more than four years and costs around $500 million. Using generative AI from end to end, Insilico was able to identify a preclinical candidate drug in one-third of the time and for one-tenth of the cost. The drug is expected to soon enter phase 2 clinical trials with patients.Sign up for early access to BioNeMo.Discover the latest in AI and healthcare — including three sessions with speakers from Amgen, a session from Evozyne and another from DeepMind on AlphaFold — at GTC, running online through Thursday, March 23.
