(Adds quote of Nvidia CEO)SAN FRANCISCO, March 21 (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp
, the U.S. semiconductor designer that dominates the
market for artificial intelligence (AI) chips, said it has
modified its flagship product into a version that is legal to
export to China.U.S. regulators last year put into place rules that stopped
Nvidia from selling its two most advanced chips, the A100 and
newer H100, to Chinese customers citing national security
concerns. Such chips are crucial to developing generative AI
technologies like OpenAI's ChatGPT and similar products.Reuters in November reported that Nvidia had designed a chip
called the A800 that reduced some capabilities of the A100 to
make the A800 legal for export to China.On Tuesday, the company said it has similarly developed a
China-export version of its H100 chip. The new chip, called the
H800, is being used by the cloud computing units of Chinese
technology firms such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd,
Baidu Inc and Tencent Holdings Ltd, a
company spokesperson said."For the young startups, many of them who are building large
language models now, and many of them jumping onto the
generative AI revolution, they can look forward to Alibaba,
Tencent and Baidu to have excellent cloud capabilities with
Nvidia's AI," Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told reporters
on Wednesday morning Asia time.U.S. regulators last fall imposed rules to slow China's
development in key technology sectors such as semiconductors and
artificial intelligence, aiming to hobble the country's efforts
to modernize its military.The rules around AI chips imposed a test that bans those
with both powerful computing capabilities and high chip-to-chip
data transfer rates. Transfer speed is important when training
artificial intelligence models on huge amounts of data because
slower transfer rates mean more training time.A chip industry source in China told Reuters the H800 mainly
reduced the chip-to-chip data transfer rate to about half the
rate of the flagship H100.The Nvidia spokesperson declined to say how the
China-focused H800 differs from the H100, except that "our 800
series products are fully compliant with export control
regulations."
