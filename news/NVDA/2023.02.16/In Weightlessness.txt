You get used to anything, even higher interest rates. This has been the message sent by the financial markets since the beginning of the year. We are currently witnessing what lawyers would probably call a form of reversal of the burden of proof. Until the end of last year, everything was going badly, until proven otherwise. Well, now everything is better, until proven otherwise. The change is important because it means looking at the positive side of a mixed indicator, instead of the dark side. This week illustrates this very well. In 2022, the combination of slightly less favorable than expected inflation numbers (that was Tuesday) with a healthy consumer sentiment and an improving housing market (that was yesterday) would have probably led investors to consider further rate hikes. This would have made them deeply depressed. Remember, there is little that financiers hate more than restrictive monetary policies.
But in 2023, no one cares. In January, stocks had ridden the wave of a sharper-than-expected slowdown in inflation, which confirmed that the U.S. central bank's rate-raising cycle would soon end. This was quite logical. All that was missing was a slightly more adverse context to test the strength of the recovery. This more adverse context materialized in February, with less unambiguous statistics and an unresolved dilemma at this stage: is it better to have strong growth and some fears about a Fed that might be even more punitive, or faltering growth that would push the Fed to return to a more flexible monetary policy? But what is important here is that the market is saying: the dilemma is not clear-cut, but both situations are ultimately acceptable if the published data remain within reasonable limits, they do not require a radical response such as a forceful rate hike as was the case a year ago. This feeling is reinforced by the non-materialization of the extreme scenarios that had been envisaged, in particular an energy cataclysm in Europe and an out-of-control coronavirus in China after the end of the zero-covid policy.
Coming back to concrete things, the US macroeconomic statistics published yesterday show that strategic parts of the economy are still strong, even if industrial production was a bit weak. Initially, this affected the indexes in the aforementioned pattern. But like the day before, they ended fairly close to their highs. In the United States, the Nasdaq 100 continued to rise, gaining 0.8%, well ahead of the S&P 500 (+0.3%). In Europe, green dominated everywhere, especially on the French CAC40, which recovered 1.2%, boosted by its large caps in luxury and industry. An American media (Bloomberg I think, I forgot where I read it) pointed out that the index compiled by Goldman Sachs to gauge investors' risk appetite based on the track record of unprofitable technology companies is at +30% since January 1st. The Nasdaq 100 is up nearly 16%.
Meanwhile, the bond market is once again looking at higher rates and/or longer, but without dampening sentiment. The US 10-year touched 3.8% yesterday, its highest level of the year. The yield curve is still inverted, which is historically a signal of recession. But one can sense that investors seem ready to put this gloomy prediction in the curiosity cupboard, along with the aforementioned energy cataclysm in Europe and the out-of-control coronavirus in China. Today, a new set of statistics from the US to test the strength of the mood I have just tried to paint. With the necessary caution, since we know that the pendulum effect is powerful on the equity markets.
