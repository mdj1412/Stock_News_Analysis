LOS ANGELES, Jan 31 (Reuters) - He looks like a giant,
angry vegetable and fights tirelessly to protect his wetland
home. He has made his way from comic books to film, television
and video games. His name is Swamp Thing, and he is returning to
the big screen with his own horror movie on a revamped DC
Studios slate.In DC Comics, Swamp Thing interacts with several other
characters' storylines, making him a common thread throughout
the greater DC Universe, often helping to save it.Fans on Tuesday reveled in DC Studios co-CEO James Gunn's
plans to bring the superhero back into the cinematic mix.“Makes sense, if they want to cover the corners of
established parts of DC, Swamp Thing is a must,” The Raven's
Loft tweeted.Josh Parker also tweeted: "I'm honestly really glad we're
getting Swamp Thing back."Another project that garnered fan praise is a TV series for
Amanda Waller, the leader of the Suicide Squad, played by Viola
Davis.“She’s the perfect way to get characters together,” Playboi
Cyr tweeted.The early positive reaction is a boon for Gunn, the director
of three "Guardians of the Galaxy" movies at Marvel, who hit
some criticism early on with his plans for the DC Universe under
new owner Warner Bros Discovery.In December, Gunn said that a Superman movie without lead
actor Henry Cavill will be part of the DC slate and Cavill will
not reprise the role because the movie focuses on “an earlier
part of Superman’s life.”For many fans, this was the first of many unsatisfying
answers. Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson tweeted more disappointing
news for some DC fans: “James Gunn and I connected, and Black
Adam will not be in their first chapter of storytelling.”While fans were overwhelmingly positive about Gunn's
direction, some were skeptical."lol I feel bad for dc. This is not even better. It’s more
variety but won’t be as huge as you think," tweeted
