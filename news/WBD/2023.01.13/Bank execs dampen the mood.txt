JPMorgan Chase & Co posted better-than-expected profits but said it has allocated $1.4 billion in anticipation of a mild recession. Wells Fargo & Co and Citigroup also set aside sums to prepare for an economic decline. Bank of America recorded better-than-expected profits, but CEO Brian Moynihan warned about an "increasingly slowing economic environment".

A part from these results, things are getting better for financial markets, after a year 2022 marked by a severe correction for risky assets. OK, this is not the first time I've had to write something like this over the last 12 months, but this time there are a few signals that are very encouraging.
And among them, the major element remains the slowdown in inflation in the US and Europe. Central banks would like to see a more proof that the economy is cooling to prove that their monetary policy transmission belt is effective, but no one is listening to them in this case.
An analytical approach to the available data has tipped the scales in favor of optimism. Yesterday, the release of US inflation for December, which showed a decrease in line with expectations, boosted sentiment. The session was choppy to say the least on Wall Street, but it ended moderately higher by 0.3% for the S&P500, 0.5% for the Nasdaq and 0.6% for the Dow Jones. The indexes would probably have accelerated more strongly if inflation had declined more than expected, which is what the more bullish investors were hoping for. In a way, these measured developments are reassuring, because they avoid the +4% sessions, which intoxicate investors and help to decouple the stock market from reality. The bond market is saying the same thing: the yield on 10-year US debt has fallen further to 3.47%. This is a sign that specialists are endorsing the scenario of a lower rate peak than was feared last fall.
In this context, investors are taking new bets and readjusting their risk grids. In Bank of America's monthly survey of global asset managers, the main risk identified since the fall of 2021 was inflation, followed by a strong global recession, continued high rates for a long time and geopolitical deterioration. With the decline in overheating prices, the number one fear of investors could change.
In other news, Chinese authorities are reportedly considering taking strategic stakes in some of the country's technology stars, such as Alibaba and Tencent, in order to maintain control over these companies. I imagine that Western investors will not be happy to be co-shareholders of a company alongside the Chinese Communist Party, even if they are already de facto shareholders in many cases.
