CrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD), today announced the release of 2023 CrowdStrike Global Threat Report – the ninth annual edition of the cybersecurity leader’s seminal report on the evolving behaviors, trends and tactics of today’s most feared nation-state, eCrime and hacktivist threat actors around the world. Now tracking the activities of 200+ adversaries – including 33 new adversaries identified in the past year alone – the report found a surge in identity-based threats, cloud exploitations, China-nexus espionage and attacks that re-weaponized previously patched vulnerabilities.

The annual report is created by the world-renowned CrowdStrike Intelligence team, leveraging data from trillions of daily events from the CrowdStrike Falcon platform and insights from CrowdStrike Falcon OverWatch. Key highlights from this year’s report include:

“The past 12 months brought a unique combination of threats to the forefront of security. Splintered eCrime groups re-emerged with greater sophistication, relentless threat actors sidestepped patched or mitigated vulnerabilities, and the feared threats of the Russia-Ukraine conflict masked more sinister and successful traction by a growing number of China-nexus adversaries,” said Adam Meyers, head of intelligence at CrowdStrike. “Today’s threat actors are smarter, more sophisticated, and more well resourced than they have ever been in the history of cybersecurity. Only by understanding their rapidly evolving tradecraft, techniques and objectives – and by embracing technology fueled by the latest threat intelligence – can companies remain one step ahead of today’s increasingly relentless adversaries.”

A closer look at some of the new adversaries:

CrowdStrike Intelligence added 33 newly tracked adversaries bringing the total number of known adversaries tracked to more than 200. More than 20 of the new additions were SPIDERS, the CrowdStrike naming convention for eCrime adversaries. Among the newly tracked BEARs (Russia-nexus adversaries), GOSSAMER BEAR’s credential-phishing operations were highly active throughout the first year of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, targeting government research labs, military suppliers, logistics companies and non-governmental organizations (NGO). CrowdStrike also introduced its first Syria-nexus adversary, DEADEYE HAWK, which was formerly tracked as the hacktivist DEADEYE JACKAL.

The CrowdStrike Intelligence team benefits from an unparalleled raw collection of intelligence data, leveraging trillions of security events per day to help stop the most ubiquitous of threats and power the CrowdStrike Falcon® platform. As the platform of consolidation in security, Falcon enables organizations to proactively stop the most sophisticated of threats via its unique combination of endpoint and identity threat protection technology, adversary-driven intelligence and human-led analysis.
