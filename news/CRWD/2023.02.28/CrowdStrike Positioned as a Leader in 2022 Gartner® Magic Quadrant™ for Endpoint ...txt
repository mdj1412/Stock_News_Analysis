CrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD), a leader in cloud-delivered protection of endpoints, cloud workloads, identity and data, today announced it has been recognized as a Leader in the 2022 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection Platforms (EPP) for the third consecutive time. CrowdStrike was among 18 vendors that Gartner evaluated.

Since pioneering the Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) category and disrupting the Next-Generation Antivirus (NGAV) market, CrowdStrike continues to deliver solutions that stop breaches across the entire enterprise attack surface. Building off a single, lightweight agent architecture, the CrowdStrike Falcon platform now spans endpoint protection, cloud security, identity protection, data protection, managed services, security and IT operations, threat intelligence and observability.

“Innovation is in our DNA. CrowdStrike disrupted the endpoint security market by inventing EDR and we believe our placement in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection Platforms for a third consecutive time validates our continued dominance in the market. With more than 21,000 customers and growing, we are committed to continuous innovation to help our customers solve their hardest security challenges amidst an ever-evolving and expanding attack surface. As an example, we are bringing over a decade of experience building an industry-leading EDR to XDR, extending the power of our detection and response capabilities beyond the endpoint to other security domains,” said Michael Sentonas, president at CrowdStrike.

Building on its market leadership in endpoint security, CrowdStrike has enabled customers to benefit from its innovations in eXtended Detection and Response (XDR), which enables organizations to detect, investigate and respond to threats across security domains from a unified console. At Fal.Con 2022, CrowdStrike introduced CrowdStrike Falcon Insight XDR, which allows customers to easily expand from EDR to XDR using new XDR connector packs. These provide rich telemetry and cross-domain detections from CrowdStrike products and third-party products to supercharge investigations for organizations.
