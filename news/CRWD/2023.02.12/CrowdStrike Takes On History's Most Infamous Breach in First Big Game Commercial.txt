“Our commercial during the Big Game puts a modern lens on the story of the Trojan Horse, the most infamous breach in history that should have been stopped,” said CrowdStrike chief marketing officer, Jennifer Johnson. “Centuries later, our mission at CrowdStrike remains the same: to stop breaches. Behind every cyberattack is a human adversary, and we pioneered the adversary-focused approach to cybersecurity to protect every organization on the planet against the most sophisticated attacks. Cybersecurity is a must-have investment for every organization and CrowdStrike stops breaches so our customers can power their businesses forward. The Big Game is an iconic stage and the perfect platform to share our brand promise of delivering Protection that Powers You to the world.”

Annual Recurring Revenue

ARR is calculated as the annualized value of CrowdStrike’s customer subscription contracts as of the measurement date, assuming any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on its existing terms. To the extent that CrowdStrike is negotiating a renewal with a customer after the expiration of the subscription, CrowdStrike continues to include that revenue in ARR if CrowdStrike is actively in discussion with such an organization for a new subscription or renewal, or until such organization notifies CrowdStrike that it is not renewing its subscription.
