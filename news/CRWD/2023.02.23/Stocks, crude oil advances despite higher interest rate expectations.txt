*Wall Street stocks rebound*Crude oil gains 2%*Benchmark 10-year yields drop*U.S. dollar gains*Safe-have gold dropsNEW YORK, Feb 23 (Reuters) -Global equities and crude oil rebounded from earlier losses
on Thursday even as economic data continued to show the strength
of the U.S. economy and validated the Federal Reserve's tight
monetary policy stance.A U.S. Labor Department report on Thursday showed that
new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last
week, pointing to a persistently tight labor market.The readings for the fourth-quarter personal consumption
expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation
measure, were revised upward to 3.7%, indicating inflation was
much stronger than initially thought and initially weighed on
sentiment.Minutes of the Federal Reserve's last meeting released
on Wednesday showed that officials favored a moderation in the
pace of rate hikes although they indicated that containing high
inflation would be key in how much further rates need to rise.
"The Fed minutes yesterday were a bit hawkish and they said
ongoing rate hikes would be necessary and that should obviously
be negative for the market," said Sandy Villere, portfolio
manager at Villere & Co in New Orleans.
"But it seems the market is starting to discount that we're
getting into the eighth or ninth innings of these rate hikes
even though the Fed is saying ongoing rate hikes would be
necessary," Villere said.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks
shares in 50 countries, was down 0.30%. European stocks
were up at just 0.06%.

better-than-expected revenue at chipmaker Nvidia Corp.

33,150.24, the S&P 500 gained 0.60% to 4,014.8 and the
Nasdaq Composite added 0.77% to 11,595.72.
"When you see strong numbers at certain companies, it could
be market moving and that's what we're seeing today - a bit of a
relief rally," Villere added.Oil prices firmed more than 1% before paring some gains,
with Russian supply curbs partially offsetting an expected rise
in U.S. inventories.

those on the 10-year pulling back from three-month highs, as

3.8807%, while the yield curve measuring the gap between the
