first time, researchers have been able to restore hand and arm
movements years after a paralyzing stroke. A separate team
reported on Monday that a staggering number of kids worldwide
show signs of being at risk for serious eating disorders. Also,
a review of data from one of the largest clinical databases for
COVID-19 research has found that heart problems after infection
with SARS-CoV-2 were less common in people who had been
vaccinated against the virus.In breaking news, see these stories from our Reuters
journalists: Merck & Co's pill for treating COVID-19
does not prevent infection when taken by a patient's household
members; tens of thousands of junior doctors in England have
voted to strike next month; U.S. to select 10 costliest drugs
for Medicare pricing negotiation.Harmful eating behaviors affect 20% of kidsRoughly one-in-five children and adolescents worldwide
suffers from harmful eating behaviors that could put them at
risk for serious disorders, with girls particularly affected, a
new review of published studies suggests.Researchers analyzed 32 studies published since 2000
involving more than 63,000 children and teens between the ages
of 6 and 18 from 16 countries. All participants, about half of
whom were girls, were considered to be physically and mentally
healthy, and all had completed a widely-used five-item screening
questionnaire for identifying eating disorders.The questionnaire asked: (1) Do you make yourself sick
because you feel uncomfortably full? (2) Do you worry you have
lost control over how much you eat? (3) Have you recently lost
more than 14 pounds (6.4 kg) in a 3-month period? (4) Do you
believe yourself to be fat when others say you are too thin? (5)
Would you say that food dominates your life?On the basis of "yes" answers to at least two of the
questions, 22% were characterized as having "disordered eating,"
a term used to describe harmful eating behaviors that may not
qualify as an eating disorder, which is considered a form of
mental illness.Rates of disordered eating were significantly higher in
girls than in boys and rose in parallel with age and body mass
index, the research team reported on Monday in JAMA Pediatrics.Disordered eating can lead to eating disorders with harmful
consequences, the authors noted. They said the high proportion
of disordered eating found in this study reinforces the
importance of screening for eating disorders by primary care
clinicians.Arm and hand movement restored years after strokeYears after suffering severe strokes, two patients who
underwent electrical stimulation of specific spinal cord regions
could once against move their arms and hands, researchers
reported on Monday in Nature Medicine.Currently, no treatments are effective for treating
post-stroke paralysis of the arms and hands once it becomes
chronic.In the new study, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of
Health, some of the improvements persisted for weeks after the
stimulation device was switched off, the researchers also found.In each patient, thin metal electrodes resembling strands of
spaghetti were implanted on the surface of the spinal cord along
the neck to stimulate so-called neural circuits, which are
populations of interconnected nerve cells that can carry out
specific functions when activated.Similar technology is already being used to restore movement
to the legs after spinal cord injury, but the wide range of
motion of the arms and hands has made restoring that movement
more challenging, the researchers said.After the treatment, the two patients could perform tasks of
varying complexity, such as grasping common household objects
and opening a lock."By stimulating these sensory nerves, we can amplify the
activity of muscles that have been weakened by stroke," study
coauthor Douglas Weber of Carnegie Mellon University said in a
statement. "Importantly, the patient retains full control of
their movements: The stimulation is assistive and strengthens
muscle activation only when patients are trying to move."The researchers are enrolling additional trial participants
to understand which stroke patients can benefit most from this
therapy and how to optimize stimulation protocols for different
severity levels.COVID vaccines linked with lower heart risksVaccination against COVID-19 was associated with fewer heart
attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular issues among people
who were infected with the coronavirus, researchers have found.Researchers used a large U.S. database to study the outcomes
of more than 1.9 million COVID-19 patients, including 217,843
who had received mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech
or Moderna or the viral vector vaccines from
Johnson & Johnson.Full vaccination was associated with a 41% lower risk of
major adverse cardiac events after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the
researchers found. Even partial vaccination was associated with
a 24% lower risk.The research team could not identify the variants that
caused patients' infections, and the study cannot prove that
vaccination protected against cardiac events.Still, this study and others have found that particularly
among individuals with pre-existing health conditions that put
them at higher risk, COVID vaccines are linked with a lower risk
of complications if people do become infected with the virus,
said study leader Dr. Girish Nadkarni of the Icahn School of
Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City."While we cannot attribute causality, it is supportive
evidence that vaccination may have beneficial effects on a
variety of post-COVID-19 complications," Nadkarni said in a
statement.The work was supported, in part, by funds from the National
Institutes of Health and the National COVID Cohort
Collaborative. The data were released on Monday in the Journal
of the American College of Cardiology and will be presented on
March 5 at the ACCâ€™s 72nd Annual Scientific Session in New
Orleans.
