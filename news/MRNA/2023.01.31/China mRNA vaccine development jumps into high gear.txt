BEIJING, Feb 1 (Reuters) - As the COVID-19 pandemic
evolves in China with the Omicron variant driving infections,
domestic companies are racing to develop an Omicron-targetted
vaccine using messenger RNA (mRNA) technology.China's home-grown vaccines are widely considered less
effective than Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna's
mRNA vaccines.It has declined to use mRNA vaccines from abroad and has yet
to approve a domestic one.Below are the major mRNA vaccine candidates being developed
in China:WALVAX BIOTECHNOLOGY CO LTDAWcorna, developed by Walvax, is the front runner and
received an emergency use approval from Indonesia in September
2022.Indonesia's food and drugs agency said the vaccine,
previously known as ARCoV, was 83.58% effective against
wild-type coronavirus strains considered common, though its
efficacy dropped to 71.17% against moderate cases of the Omicron
variant.Walvax, which is based in the southwestern Chinese city of
Kunming, said in June the candidate had triggered a stronger
antibody response against Omicron as a booster dose than
Sinovac's shot in a clinical trial.At the time the shot, co-developed with Suzhou Abogen
Biosciences and a Chinese military-backed research institution,
was the most advanced Chinese mRNA candidate in terms of
clinical trial progress.It was being tested in China, Mexico and Indonesia.Walvax said the vaccine could be transported and stored at a
temperatures of from 2 Celsius to 8 Celsius, greatly reducing
the cold chain challenges in developing countries.CANSINO BIOLOGICSOn Jan. 5, Tianjin-based CanSino Biologics reported
"positive" interim data for its experimental mRNA booster in a
mid-stage trial and said it had begun "test production".The vaccine, known as CS-2034, targets Omicron, and the
company said it could produce 100 million doses of the vaccine
during the first phase of manufacturing.SUZHOU ABOGEN BIOSCIENCES COThe firm said in December that it launched Phase III trials
in the Philippines and the United Arab Emirates of an optimised
version of the original ARCoV vaccine, targeting the BA.4/5
subvariants of Omicron.SINOPHARMSinopharm said in January its biotech unit received Chinese
regulatory approval for clinical trials of its mRNA COVID-19
vaccine targeting Omicron.The unit, based in the commercial hub of Shanghai, has built
a research and development platform, as well as workshops with
annual production capacity of 2 billion doses of mRNA vaccine,
Sinopharm said.STEMIRNA THERAPEUTICSIt said in December that it received an emergency use
authorisation from the Ministry of Health in Laos for its mRNA
vaccine.After getting approval in China it would be ready for mass
production and the company is building a plant in Laos that can
produce 20 million doses annually, the biotech startup said.Compared with inactivated boosters, Stemirna's vaccine
showed a 27.4-fold increase in neutralizing antibodies against
the Omicron 14 days after booster immunisation.The company, with backers including private equity fund
Sequoia Capital China, said the vaccine is stable under
temperature conditions of minus 15 Celsius to minus 25 Celsius
with a shelf life of up to two years.CSPC PHARMACEUTICAL GROUP LTDThe firm got approval to conduct trials of its mRNA shot in
April last year, at about the same time as CanSino.Last August, it reported a "good" safety profile for the
shot, called SYS6006, and in a November 2022 filing revealed
positive progress of the candidate in several clinical studies.GUANGZHOU RIBOBIO CO LTDIt began an early stage clinical trial in China in January
2022 and said in June last year that its mRNA candidate
specifically targeting Omicron has been approved for clinical
trial in the Philippines.AIM VACCINE CO LTDIt said in January 2022 its candidate appeared safe and able
to trigger an immune response based on data from an early-stage
Phase I trial.Last October, it filed for a clinical trial in China of its
Omicron BA.5 subvariant targeting vaccine candidate.RNACUREIt has partnered with Walvax to develop mRNA vaccines
targeting variants. It said in January 2022 it was applying for
clinical trials for a candidate that showed broad-spectrum
protection against variants in animal tests.
