Jan 9 (Reuters) - Ocugen Inc said on Monday the
COVID-19 vaccine developed by its Indian partner Bharat Biotech
International Ltd met the main goals of a trial in the United
States.The vaccine, sold under brand name Covaxin, showed an immune
response in individuals who had not received a COVID vaccine
previously as well as those vaccinated with mRNA vaccines by
Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc, meeting its main
goals, Ocugen said.The traditional form of vaccine, which uses killed virus
particles to trigger an immune response, was also found to be
well-tolerated in both sets of participants in the trial
comprising 419 patients, the company said.Shares of Ocugen were up 14.6% to $1.49 in premarket trade.Covaxin is not cleared for use in any age group in the
United States, but is one of the two most widely used COVID
vaccines in India and has received emergency use listing from
the World Health Organization (WHO).Ocugen did not provide details about its submission to the
U.S. FDA for the vaccine. The company is responsible for
conducting trials and commercialization of the shot in the
United States under a partnership with Bharat Biotech.Covaxin has struggled in the United States, after the WHO
suspended supply of the shot in April last year to allow time to
the manufacturer to upgrade facilities and address deficiencies
found in an inspection.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration had also paused trials
of the shot after WHO's inspection of Bharat Biotech's facility.
The hold was lifted in May.
