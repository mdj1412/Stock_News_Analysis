DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Moderna
chief executive Stephane Bancel said on Wednesday the U.S.
company was in active discussions to supply COVID-19 vaccines to
China.Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the World
Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, he said the talks with
Beijing also covered the topic of factories, and other products
including cancer treatments."What I really want to understand is how do we help the
Chinese government as to what are the needs they have from a
healthcare standpoint," he said.He gave no further details, but said he hoped to visit
China this year.Beijing has so far insisted on using only Chinese-made
COVID-19 vaccines for its own population, but the country is
beset by a raging COVID outbreak following a U-turn from Beijing
on previously ultra-tight anti-pandemic curbs.Health experts fear the outbreak could intensify in
areas less well equipped to handle it, asmillions of Chineseliving in cities head to their hometowns this week for the
Lunar New Year holidays.China-made COVID vaccines are of the inactivated virus
type and not based on the messenger RNA technology used in the
most widely used shots developed by Moderna and Pfizer
-BioNTech.The only foreign shots being used in China areBioNTech dosesshipped by Germany late last year and being given to its
citizens living there.The go-ahead to allow expatriate Germans to get a
BioNTech shot came as cases surge since Beijing dismantled the
zero-COVID lockdown regime.As regards cancer treatments, Moderna has been working
with Merck on an experimental vaccine against melanoma
based on the mRNA technology used in successful COVID-19
vaccines. The company has said it plans to study the approach it
has used in lung and other highly mutated cancers.Earlier, in a WEF panel discussion, Bancel said he would
like to have factories making vaccines based on its messenger
RNA technology on every continent as the U.S. company prepares
to build four facilities.The company, whose COVID-19 vaccines are made in the United
States and Switzerland, is building or planning to build plants
in Canada, Australia, Britain and Kenya, he said.
