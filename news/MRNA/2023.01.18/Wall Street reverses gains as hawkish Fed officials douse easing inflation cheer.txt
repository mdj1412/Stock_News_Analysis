gains by early afternoon on Wednesday as hawkish comments from
Federal Reserve officials sparked worries that the central bank
may not be pausing interest rate hikes any time soon.Markets reacted positively to data, which showed retail
sales and producer prices declined more than expected in
December.However, the gains were short-lived as St. Louis Fed
President James Bullard and Cleveland Fed President Loretta
Mester stressed on the need to raise rates beyond 5% to bring
inflation to heel.It also highlighted the disparity between the U.S. central
bank's estimate of its terminal rate and market expectations,
which were of the rate peaking at 4.88% by June. Traders are now
betting on a 25-basis point rate hike in February."Despite the producer prices numbers being okay today, it
was just a harsh reminder that we're a long way from a Fed
pivot," said Dennis Dick, trader at Triple D Trading."This market is very hopeful that we're going to get a soft
landing and every time you have hawkish comments from the Fed,
it feels you're not going to get that."Focus also remains on the earnings season as it gathers pace

of higher interest rates.Analysts now expect year-over-year earnings from S&P 500
companies to decline 2.6% for the quarter, according to
Refinitiv data, compared with a 1.6% decline in the beginning of

hopes that a moderation in inflationary pressures could give the
Fed cover to dial down the size of its interest rate hikes.At 12:27 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
