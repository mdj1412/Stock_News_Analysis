Jan 26 (Reuters) - Advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration on Thursday unanimously voted in favor of
targeting the same coronavirus strain for initial COVID-19
vaccine doses and boosters going forward, but some expressed
skepticism about whether all Americans need to receive the shots
annually.The agency is trying to simplify its COVID-19 vaccine policy
as it considers whether to recommend Americans get an annual
booster shot for the virus. But several members of the expert
advisory group asked for more robust data on benefits of annual
shots for younger, healthier people."We're in a very different place. We have a lot of
population immunity," said Hayley Gans, professor of pediatrics
at Stanford University Medical Center. "Now that people are
immune, how long does that last?"Vaccine makers Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech SE
and Moderna Inc introduced late last year
updated versions of their COVID vaccines tailored to target
Omicron variants as well as the original coronavirus. In the
United States, those were used only as booster shots.The FDA advisory group unanimously backed using those shots
for the primary series for those who have yet to be vaccinated
against COVID-19 as well.The FDA said it envisioned holding a meeting later in the
year to determine the composition of shots for the fall,
although some vaccine makers might be able to produce updated
shots more quickly.Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna were able to produce the
currently available messenger RNA boosters in about three months
last year, but Novavax Inc said on Thursday it would
require six months to make a new version of its protein-based
COVID-19 vaccine designed to match circulating coronavirus
variants.FDA would consider an earlier timeline for vaccines like
Novavax's following the company's manufacturing assessment,
Peter Marks, director of the agency's Center for Biologics
Evaluation & Research, said.Health officials in the Biden administration have suggested
that annual, updated COVID-19 booster shots could provide a high
level of protection against severe disease.
