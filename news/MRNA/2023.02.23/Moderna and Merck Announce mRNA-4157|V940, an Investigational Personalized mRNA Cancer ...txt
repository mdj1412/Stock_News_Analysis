CAMBRIDGE - Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRNA), a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines, and Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today announced that mRNA-4157/V940, an investigational personalized mRNA cancer vaccine, in combination with KEYTRUDA, Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the adjuvant treatment of patients with high-risk melanoma following complete resection.The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation based on positive data from the Phase 2b KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 trial.'The FDA's Breakthrough Designation for mRNA-4157/V940 in combination with KEYTRUDA reflects the excitement that we have for the potential promise of individualized cancer treatments,' said Stephen Hoge, M.D., Moderna's President. 'mRNA-4157/V940 in combination with KEYTRUDA provided the first demonstration of efficacy for an investigational mRNA cancer treatment in a randomized clinical trial and potentially represents a new frontier in treating melanoma and other cancers. We look forward to publishing the full data set and sharing the results at an upcoming oncology medical conference, as well as continuing discussions with health authorities. We are grateful to the FDA for this designation.''This is an important milestone in the development of mRNA-4157/V940 in combination with KEYTRUDA,' said Dr. Eric H. Rubin, senior vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. 'We look forward to working with the FDA, in collaboration with Moderna, to conduct a rigorous and rapid clinical development program with a focus on addressing the needs of this important patient population.'The FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation is granted to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition, and when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies on at least one clinically significant endpoint.The companies will continue to discuss the results with regulatory authorities, initiate a Phase 3 study in adjuvant melanoma in 2023, and rapidly expand to additional tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer.About mRNA-4157/V940mRNA-4157/V940 is a novel investigational messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based personalized cancer vaccine consisting of a single synthetic mRNA coding for up to 34 neoantigens that is designed and produced based on the unique mutational signature of the patient's tumor. Upon administration into the body, the algorithmically derived and mRNA-encoded neoantigen sequences are endogenously translated and undergo natural cellular antigen processing and presentation, a key step in adaptive immunity.Personalized cancer vaccines are designed to prime the immune system so that a patient can generate a tailored antitumor response specific to their tumor mutation signature. mRNA-4157/V940 is designed to stimulate an immune response by generating specific T cell responses based on the unique mutational signature of a patient's tumor. KEYTRUDA is an immunotherapy that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. Based on early clinical studies, combining mRNA-4157/V940 with KEYTRUDA may potentially provide an additive benefit and enhance T cell-mediated destruction of tumor cells.About KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 (NCT03897881)KEYNOTE-942 is an ongoing randomized, open-label Phase 2b trial that enrolled 157 patients with stage III/IV melanoma. Following complete surgical resection, patients were randomized to receive mRNA-4157/V940 (nine total doses of mRNA-4157) and KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks up to 18 cycles [for approximately one year]) versus KEYTRUDA alone for approximately one year until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint is recurrence-free survival, and secondary endpoints include distant metastasis-free survival and safety.Key eligibility criteria for the trial included: patients with resectable cutaneous melanoma at high risk of recurrence, patients with complete resection within 13 weeks prior to the first dose of KEYTRUDA, patients were disease free at study entry (after surgery) with no loco-regional relapse or distant metastasis and no clinical evidence of brain metastases.About melanomaMelanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of pigment-producing cells. The rates of melanoma have been rising over the past few decades, with nearly 325,000 new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2020. In the U.S., skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed, and melanoma accounts for a large majority of skin cancer deaths. Each year, it is estimated there will be nearly 100,000 new cases of melanoma diagnosed and almost 8,000 deaths resulting from the disease in the U.S. The five-year survival rates are estimated to be 60.3% for stage III and 16.2% for stage IV.About KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry's largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.About MerckAt Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, we are unified around our purpose: We use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world.
