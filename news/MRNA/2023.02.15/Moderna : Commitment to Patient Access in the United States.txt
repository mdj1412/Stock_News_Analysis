        Moderna's vaccines have protected the lives of hundreds of millions of people around the world from COVID-19 and have dramatically lessened the burden of the pandemic to society.
      

        As the public health emergency ends, the United States government will no longer be providing vaccines at no cost. Moderna remains committed to ensuring that people in the United States will have access to our COVID-19 vaccines regardless of ability to pay.
      

        Moderna's COVID-19 vaccines will continue to be available at no cost for insured people whether they receive them at their doctors' offices or local pharmacies. For uninsured or underinsured people, Moderna's patient assistance program* will provide COVID-19 vaccines at no cost.
      

        Everyone in the United States will have access to Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine regardless of their ability to pay.
      

        *Available after the expiry of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency on May 11, 2023.
