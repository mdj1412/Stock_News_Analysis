Feb 15 (Reuters) - Senator Bernie Sanders said on
Wednesday Moderna Inc's chief executive officer
St√©phane Bancel will testify next month in front of the senate
on the drugmaker's plans to raise the price of its coronavirus
vaccine.In January, Sanders had written to Bancel to refrain from
quadrupling the price of COVID-19 vaccine, after Moderna said it
was considering pricing its vaccine at $110 to $130 per dose in
the United States, when it shifts from government contracting to
commercial distribution.The drugmaker, however, had said earlier today insured
people could avail the vaccine at no cost at their doctor's
office or local pharmacies, once the government mandate to give
it for free expires on May 11.Moderna also added that uninsured patient can buy the
vaccine through Moderna's patient assistance program at no cost.Sanders, chairman of the Senate's Health, Education, Labor
and Pensions committee, has railed against high drug prices and
backed Medicare-for-all. His chairmanship of the HELP committee
could put drug companies in his crosshairs.
