Jan 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. health regulator on Monday
proposed one dose of the latest updated COVID-19 shot annually
for healthy adults, similar to the influenza immunization
campaign, as it aims to simplify the country's COVID-vaccine
strategy.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also asked its panel
of external advisers to consider the usage of two COVID vaccine
shots a year for some young children, older adults and persons
with compromised immunity.The regulator proposed the need for routine selection of
variants for updating the vaccine, similar to the way strains
for flu vaccines are changed annually, in briefing documents
ahead of a meeting of its panel on Thursday.The FDA hopes annual immunization schedules may contribute
to less complicated vaccine deployment and fewer vaccine
administration errors, leading to improved vaccine coverage
rates.The agency's proposal was on expected lines, following its
announcement of its intention for the update last month.The Biden administration has also been planning for a
campaign of vaccine boosters every fall season.Currently, most people in the United States need to first
get two doses of the original COVID vaccine spaced at least
three to four weeks apart, depending on the vaccine, followed by
a booster dose a few months later.Pfizer's primary vaccine doses for children and people
involve three shots, with the third a bivalent shot given about
two months later.If the panel votes in favor of the proposal, Pfizer Inc
and Moderna Inc's bivalent vaccines, which
target both the Omicron and the original variants, would be used
for all COVID vaccine doses, and not just as boosters.
