March 10 (Reuters) - Northern States Power Co asked to
extend the operating license of its Monticello nuclear reactor
in Minnesota by another two decades, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) said on Friday.Monticello is currently greenlighted to run through
September 2030. The NRC said it would hold a public meeting on
March 22 in Monticello, Minnesota, on the environmental review
process for the extension application.Northern States Power is a unit of Minnesota energy company
Xcel Energy Inc.Minnesota is among a swelling number of U.S. states with
climate-related goals to reach net-zero emissions in coming
years, with the northern Midwest state aiming for a 2040
deadline, and nuclear power generation has become a centerpiece
to many of those plans.The 93 nuclear reactors operating in the United States began
with 40-year permits and most have already asked for 20-year
extensions.The reactor in Monticello, located about 35 miles northwest
of Minneapolis, opened in 1971 and has already been granted one
20-year extension.Many states are now aiming to keep reactors online longer as
a bridge from mostly fossil-fueled power plants to mainly
renewable electricity sources like wind and solar to meet their
clean energy goals.In 2022, the largest share of power generated in Minnesota
came from coal, at 27%, with the rest coming from nuclear at
24%, wind at 24%, natural gas at 18%, and other fuels such as
solar, wood and hydro at about 7%.Ten years ago, in 2012, about 43% of electricity generated
in Minnesota came from coal, while 23% came from nuclear, 15%
from wind and 13% from gas. The rest was again from other
sources such as hydro, wood and other biomass.Unlike power produced from fossil fuels such as coal, gas or
oil, nuclear power produces virtually no climate-warming
greenhouse gasses, which has increased its popularity in recent
years.Nuclear power does produce radioactive waste, and deadly
high-profile accidents around the world involving nuclear
meltdowns in recent decades have been a barrier to expanding the
industry.
