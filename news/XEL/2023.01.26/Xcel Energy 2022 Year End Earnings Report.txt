Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: XEL) today reported 2022 GAAP and ongoing earnings of $1.74 billion, or $3.17 per share, compared with $1.60 billion, or $2.96 per share in the same period in 2021.

Earnings reflect capital investment recovery and other regulatory outcomes, partially offset by increases in depreciation, interest charges and operating and maintenance (O&M) expenses.

“2022 was another solid year for Xcel Energy, where we delivered for our customers, our communities, our employees, and our investors. We delivered earnings of $3.17 per share, which is the 18th consecutive year we have met or beat our original earnings guidance,” said Bob Frenzel, chairman, president and CEO of Xcel Energy.

“Our execution towards our clean energy future continues to lead the industry with regulatory approval in Colorado and the Upper Midwest of our plans to dramatically increase the renewable energy available to our customers while retiring all of our coal-fired plants. And as a result of the energy tax provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, we are able to reduce the cost to our customers over the assets’ lives by billions of dollars as we power the nation’s clean energy transition.

“Xcel Energy also delivered strong reliability for our customers and communities in 2022 despite increasingly volatile weather causing high energy demand events during hotter-than-normal summers in Colorado and the Upper Midwest, and Winter Storm Elliott which knocked out critical electric and gas service across the country.”

At 9:00 a.m. CDT today, Xcel Energy will host a conference call to review financial results. To participate in the call, please dial in 5 to 10 minutes prior to the start and follow the operator’s instructions.

XCEL ENERGY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Investor Relations Earnings Release (Unaudited)

Due to the seasonality of Xcel Energy’s operating results, quarterly financial results are not an appropriate base from which to project annual results.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures such as ongoing return on equity (ROE), ongoing earnings and ongoing diluted EPS. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a measure of a company’s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that adjusts measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Xcel Energy’s management uses non-GAAP measures for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, in determining performance-based compensation and communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement investors’ understanding of our performance and should not be considered alternatives for financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures are discussed in more detail below and may not be comparable to other companies’ similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures.

Ongoing ROE

Ongoing ROE is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of Xcel Energy or each subsidiary, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items, by each entity’s average stockholder’s equity. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results.

Earnings Adjusted for Certain Items (Ongoing Earnings and Ongoing Diluted EPS)

GAAP diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock (i.e., common stock equivalents) were settled. The weighted average number of potentially dilutive shares outstanding used to calculate Xcel Energy Inc.’s diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method. Ongoing earnings reflect adjustments to GAAP earnings (net income) for certain items. Ongoing diluted EPS for Xcel Energy is calculated by dividing net income or loss, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period. Ongoing diluted EPS for each subsidiary is calculated by dividing the net income or loss for such subsidiary, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period.

We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of Xcel Energy’s core earnings and underlying performance. We believe these measurements are useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of our subsidiaries. For the three and twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no such adjustments to GAAP earnings and therefore GAAP earnings equal ongoing earnings for these periods.

Note 1. Earnings Per Share Summary

Xcel Energy’s 2022 earnings were $3.17 per share compared to $2.96 per share in 2021. The increase was driven by regulatory outcomes, partially offset by higher depreciation, O&M expenses and interest charges. Costs for natural gas significantly increased in 2022 due to market conditions. However, fluctuations in electric and natural gas revenues associated with changes in fuel and purchased power and/or natural gas sold and transported generally do not significantly impact earnings (changes in revenues are offset by the related variation in costs).

Note 2. Regulated Utility Results

Estimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings — Unusually hot summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales, while mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales. The estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances, the amount of natural gas or electricity historically used per degree of temperature and excludes any incremental related operating expenses that could result due to storm activity or vegetation management requirements. As a result, weather deviations from normal levels can affect Xcel Energy’s financial performance. However, sales true-up and decoupling mechanisms in Minnesota and Colorado predominately mitigate the positive and adverse impacts of weather.

Normal weather conditions are defined as either the 10, 20 or 30-year average of actual historical weather conditions. The historical period of time used in the calculation of normal weather differs by jurisdiction, based on regulatory practice. To calculate the impact of weather on demand, a demand factor is applied to the weather impact on sales. Extreme weather variations, windchill and cloud cover may not be reflected in weather-normalized estimates.

Electric Margin — Electric margin is presented as electric revenues less electric fuel and purchased power expenses. Expenses incurred for electric fuel and purchased power are generally recovered through various regulatory recovery mechanisms. As a result, changes in these expenses are generally offset in operating revenues.

Electric revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses are impacted by fluctuations in the price of natural gas, coal and uranium. These price fluctuations generally have minimal impact on earnings impact due to fuel recovery mechanisms. In addition, electric customers receive a credit for PTCs generated, which reduce electric revenue and income taxes.

Natural Gas Margin — Natural gas margin is presented as natural gas revenues less the cost of natural gas sold and transported. Expenses incurred for the cost of natural gas sold are generally recovered through various regulatory recovery mechanisms. As a result, changes in these expenses are generally offset in operating revenues.

Natural gas expense varies with changing sales and the cost of natural gas. However, fluctuations in the cost of natural gas generally have minimal earnings impact due to cost recovery mechanisms.

O&M Expenses — O&M expenses increased $170 million year-to-date due to the following approximately equal drivers: inflation and impacts of supply chain constraints; operational activities (vegetation management, repairs/maintenance and storms); costs for technology and customer programs; insurance-related costs; recognition of previously deferred amounts related to the 2021 Texas rate case; and other.

Depreciation and Amortization — Depreciation and amortization increased $292 million year-to-date. The increase was primarily driven by capital investment, recognition of previously deferred costs related to the Texas Electric Rate Case and several wind farms going into service.

Other Income (Expense) — Other income (expense) decreased $18 million year-to-date, largely related to rabbi trust performance, which is primarily offset in O&M expenses (employee benefit costs).

Earnings from Equity Method Investments — Earnings from equity method investments decreased $26 million year-to-date. The year-to-date change was largely attributable to the performance of the EIP funds, which invest in energy technology companies.

Interest Charges — Interest charges increased $111 million year-to-date. The increase was largely due to higher long-term debt levels to fund capital investments and higher interest rates.

(a)

Wind PTCs are credited to customers (reduction to revenue) and do not have a material impact on net income.

(b)

Regulatory differences for income tax primarily relate to the credit of excess deferred taxes to customers through the average rate assumption method. Income tax benefits associated with the credit of excess deferred credits are offset by corresponding revenue reductions.

Income tax benefit increased $65 million year-to-date. The year-to-date increase was primarily driven by an increase in wind PTCs due to greater production at existing wind farms, several new wind farms going into service and an increase in the PTC rate partially offset by higher pretax earnings.

Next steps in the procedural schedule are expected to be as follows:

NSP-Minnesota — 2022 Minnesota Natural Gas Rate Case — In November 2021, NSP-Minnesota filed a request with the MPUC for a natural gas rate increase of $36 million, or 6.6%. The filing is based on a 2022 forecast test year and includes a requested ROE of 10.5%, an equity ratio of 52.5% and a rate base of $934 million. In December 2021, the MPUC approved an interim rate increase of $25 million, subject to refund, effective Jan. 1, 2022.

In October 2022, NSP-Minnesota and various parties filed an uncontested settlement, which includes the following key terms:

In December 2022, the ALJ recommended MPUC approval of the settlement. A MPUC order is expected in the first half of 2023.

NSP-Minnesota — 2021 North Dakota Natural Gas Rate Case — In September 2021, NSP-Minnesota filed a request with the North Dakota Public Service Commission (NDPSC) for a natural gas rate increase of $7 million, or 10.5%. The filing is based on a ROE of 10.5%, an equity ratio of 52.54%, a 2022 forecast test year and a rate base of $124 million. Interim rates of $7 million, subject to refund, were implemented on Nov. 1, 2021.

In May 2022, NSP-Minnesota and NDPSC Staff reached a settlement, which reflects a rate increase of $5 million, based on a 9.8% ROE and 52.54% equity ratio. In October 2022, the NDPSC approved the settlement and final rates were implemented on Nov. 1, 2022.

NSP-Minnesota — 2022 South Dakota Electric Rate Case — In June 2022, NSP-Minnesota filed a South Dakota electric rate case seeking a revenue increase of approximately $44 million. The filing is based on a 2021 historic test year adjusted for certain known and measurable changes for 2022 and 2023, a ROE of 10.75%, rate base of approximately $947 million and an equity ratio of 53%. Interim rates were implemented on Jan. 1, 2023. A decision from the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission and final rates are expected to be approved in mid-2023.

PSCo — Colorado Electric Rate Case — In November 2022, PSCo filed an electric rate case seeking a net increase of $262 million, or 8.2%. The total request reflects a $312 million increase, which includes $50 million of authorized costs currently recovered through various rider mechanisms. The request is based on a 10.25% ROE, an equity ratio of 55.7% and a 2023 forecast test year with a 2023 year-end rate base of $11.3 billion. PSCo requested rates effective in September 2023. A procedural schedule is expected to be established by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) in the first quarter of 2023.

SPS — New Mexico Electric Rate Case — In November 2022, SPS filed an electric rate case with the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission seeking a revenue increase of $78 million, or 10%. The request is based on a future test year ending June 30, 2024, a ROE of 10.75%, an equity ratio of 54.7% and rate base of $2.4 billion.

Next steps in the procedural schedule are expected to be as follows:

SPS — Texas Fuel Reconciliation — In 2021, SPS filed to recover $88 million of Winter Storm Uri costs over 24 months, as part of the Texas fuel surcharge filing, with total under-recovered costs of $121 million. In April 2022, interim rates designed to recover $121 million over 30 months were approved, subject to Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) approval through the triennial Fuel Reconciliation proceeding.

In July 2022, the intervenors filed recommendations. The Texas Industrial Energy Consumers and PUCT staff recommended disallowances of approximately $10 million (off-system sales margins). The Office of Public Utility Counsel recommended disallowances of approximately $15 million (off-system sales margins and adjustment to energy loss factors). The Alliance of Xcel Municipalities recommended disallowances of approximately $100 million (natural gas storage, contracted capability and off-system sales margins).

In November 2022, the ALJs found that costs were prudently incurred and recommended no disallowances. A final PUCT decision is anticipated in the first quarter of 2023.

Note 5. Earnings Guidance and Long-Term EPS and Dividend Growth Rate Objectives

Xcel Energy 2023 Earnings Guidance — Xcel Energy’s 2023 GAAP and ongoing earnings guidance is a range of $3.30 to $3.40 per share.(a)

Key assumptions as compared with 2022 levels unless noted:

(a)

Ongoing earnings is calculated using net income and adjusting for certain nonrecurring or infrequent items that are, in management’s view, not reflective of ongoing operations. Ongoing earnings could differ from those prepared in accordance with GAAP for unplanned and/or unknown adjustments. Xcel Energy is unable to forecast if any of these items will occur or provide a quantitative reconciliation of the guidance for ongoing EPS to corresponding GAAP EPS.

Long-Term EPS and Dividend Growth Rate Objectives — Xcel Energy expects to deliver an attractive total return to our shareholders through a combination of earnings growth and dividend yield, based on the following long-term objectives:
