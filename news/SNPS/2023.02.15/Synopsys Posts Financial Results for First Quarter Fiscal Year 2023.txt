Q1 FY 2023 Financial Highlights
Revenue: $1.361 billionGAAP earnings per diluted share: $1.75Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share: $2.62MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Feb. 15, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Synopsys, Inc. (Nasdaq: SNPS) today reported results for its first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 was $1.361 billion, compared to $1.270 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.
"Synopsys delivered a solid start to the year. Building on our strength and momentum from 2022, we met or exceeded all of our guidance targets, and based on the continued robust design activity, we remain confident in our business," said Aart de Geus, Chair and CEO of Synopsys. "As a key technology catalyst in the 'Smart Everything' world, we are driving groundbreaking innovations that radically advance the design of complex chips and software. For FY'23, we are reaffirming our targets of 14-15% revenue growth and continued non-GAAP operating margin expansion, and expect to grow non-GAAP earnings per share by 18-19%."
GAAP ResultsOn a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 was $271.5 million, or $1.75 per diluted share, compared to $313.7 million, or $1.99 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.     
Non-GAAP ResultsOn a non-GAAP basis, net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 was $406.7 million, or $2.62 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $376.9 million, or $2.40 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.
For a reconciliation of net income, earnings per diluted share and other measures on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, see "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation" in the accompanying tables below. 
Business Segments Beginning in fiscal year 2023, Synopsys began reporting revenue and operating income in three segments: (1) Design Automation, which includes digital and custom integrated circuit (IC) design software, verification hardware and software products, manufacturing-related design products, field-programmable gate array (FPGA) design software, optical products, professional services, and other; (2) Design IP, which includes our Synopsys IP portfolio; and (3) Software Integrity, which includes solutions that test software code for security vulnerabilities and quality defects, as well as professional and managed services. Further information regarding these segments is provided at the end of this press release.
Financial Targets Synopsys also provided its consolidated financial targets for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2023. These financial targets assume no further changes to export control restrictions or the current U.S. government "Entity List" restrictions. These targets constitute forward-looking statements and are based on current expectations. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these targets, see "Forward-Looking Statements" below.

GAAP to Non-GAAP ReconciliationSynopsys continues to provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but acknowledges evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, Synopsys presents non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Synopsys' operating results in a manner that focuses on what Synopsys believes to be its core business operations and what Synopsys uses to evaluate its business operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. These non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.  Synopsys' management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, superior to, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Synopsys' management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP financial measures that include: (i) the amortization of acquired intangible assets, (ii) the impact of stock compensation, (iii) acquisition-related items, (iv) restructuring charges, (v) the effects of certain settlements, final judgments and loss contingencies related to legal proceedings, and (vi) the income tax effect of non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments; and the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude such information in order to assess the performance of Synopsys' business operations and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods.
Synopsys' annual non-GAAP tax rate was 18% for fiscal year 2022, and it previously elected to maintain an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 18% for fiscal year 2023 given uncertainty surrounding further U.S. corporate tax law changes. This annual non-GAAP tax rate was based on an evaluation of Synopsys' historical and projected mix of U.S. and international profit before tax, taking into account the impact of non-GAAP adjustments, U.S. tax law changes, as well as other factors such as its current tax structure, existing tax positions and expected recurring tax incentives.
Based on a re-evaluation of federal tax laws that require research and development expense to be capitalized commencing in Synopsys' first quarter of fiscal year 2023, Synopsys has elected to update its annual non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2023 to 16%. Synopsys does not currently anticipate any additional significant changes to U.S. corporate tax law, its geographic earnings mix, or significant tax law changes in major jurisdictions where it operates that would result in further adjustment to its fiscal year 2023 annual non-GAAP tax rate. 
When possible, Synopsys provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed below, as well as Item 2.02 of Synopsys' Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 15, 2023, for additional information about the measures Synopsys uses to evaluate its core business operations. Synopsys is unable to provide a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP guidance measures to the corresponding GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis because doing so would not be possible without unreasonable effort due to, among other things, the potential variability and limited visibility of the excluded items. For the same reasons, Synopsys is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.

(1) Synopsys manages the business on a long-term, annual basis, and considers quarterly fluctuations of revenue and profitability as normal elements of our business. Amounts may not foot due to rounding.
