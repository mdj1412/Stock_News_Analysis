To outline ComEd’s vision for how it will advance a low-carbon energy future that benefits all of its customers and communities in northern Illinois, the electric company today released its “ComEd 2030” vision. ComEd 2030 identifies key trends and priorities for how ComEd will meet customers’ quickly changing needs and expectations for the rest of this decade and beyond.

“The ComEd electric grid will need to work in new ways to enable millions of electric vehicles hitting the roads and plugging in. Customers will need easy ways to connect the many thousands of clean distributed energy resources that are coming online, such as wind and solar power and battery storage. And ComEd’s service must remain highly reliable and resilient for customers as climate change challenges us with more severe weather events,” said ComEd CEO Gil Quiniones.

ComEd 2030 sets out a vision of how the company’s investments in its infrastructure and customer programs can advance critical policy goals, including the goals of the landmark Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), which aims to decarbonize the state’s power sector by 2045. And it is consistent with the formal Grid Plan for the years 2023 through 2027 that ComEd will present to the Illinois Commerce Commission in January 2023.

ComEd 2030 Priorities

ComEd 2030 introduces five pillars that will guide ComEd’s work for customers and communities:

ComEd 2030 is centered on the more than 9 million people who call the company’s northern Illinois service territory home, and consistent with the CEJA law, focuses on ensuring that under-resourced communities are prioritized in the region’s clean energy transition.

“Most important is our commitment to make sure the benefits of the digital and decarbonized energy future flow equitably to communities with the greatest need,” Quiniones said. “ComEd is one of the very few entities in the region that serves everyone. Because we are a company that operates in the public trust, we have a very special focus on community well-being, justice and opportunity for all.”

Harnessing Customer and Industry Trends

ComEd 2030 identifies five key trends for the changing customer needs ComEd will need to meet and its opportunities to provide more value for all of the communities it serves:

In addition to being consistent with ComEd’s 2023-2027 Grid Plan, ComEd 2030 is also coordinated with parent company Exelon’s “Path to Clean,” which sets goals to reduce operations-driven emissions across the company’s businesses by 50% by 2030 and achieve net-zero operations by 2050. In addition to reducing company emissions, Path to Clean is focused on supporting customers and communities in reaching their clean energy and emissions reduction goals.

A Position of Strength

ComEd 2030 builds on significant performance improvements ComEd has made in the last decade to deliver safe, reliable, clean and affordable energy to the more than 9 million people who call northern Illinois home.

“To prepare for the digital and decarbonized future, ComEd has important work ahead,” Quiniones said. “But we start from a position of strength. In the last decade, we have transformed our network into a modern grid. The value delivered to our customers and communities has been substantial.”

ComEd 2030 outlines those areas of improved performance that ComEd will build on, including:
