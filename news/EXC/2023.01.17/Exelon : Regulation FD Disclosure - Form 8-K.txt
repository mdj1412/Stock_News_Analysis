Section 7 - Regulation FD Disclosure


Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure






On January 17, 2023, Commonwealth Edison Company ("ComEd") will file a petition with the Illinois Commerce Commission ("ICC") seeking approval of a Multi-Year Rate Plan for 2024-2027 (Rate Plan). The Rate Plan is being filed pursuant to Section 16-108.18 of the Illinois Public Utilities Act. It will support a Multi-Year Grid Plan (Grid Plan) that covers planned investments on the electric distribution system within ComEd's service area. The Grid Plan also extends through 2027 and will be filed with the ICC on January 17. The Rate Plan would establish annual base rate revenue requirements for electric delivery services as follows:













Year


Base Rate Revenue Requirement




2024


$3,757,912,000




2025


$3,932,500,000




2026


$4,149,156,000




2027


$4,351,935,000









ComEd's requested revenue requirements are based on requested returns on common equity of 10.50%, 10.55%, 10.60%, and 10.65% in 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively, and on capital structures that reflect between 50.58% and 51.19% common equity. The approved revenue requirements will be reconciled to actual costs incurred during each such year, subject to certain limitations and to ICC review, in accordance with law. In the filing, ComEd will ask the ICC to phase-in the new rates by deferring 35% of the 2024 base rate increase, with that amount being recovered in 2026.






The Rate Plan and Grid Plan filings will be available on the ICC website.






The ICC must review the Rate and Grid Plans in a proceeding on a consolidated basis and issue a decision by mid-December 2023. Other parties are expected to join or intervene in that proceeding. The ultimate outcome of that process cannot be determined at this time.
