Exelon Corporation (Nasdaq: EXC) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022.

“In 2022, Exelon showcased our ability as a pure transmission and distribution company to deliver on our financial and operational commitments. Because of the partnership with our customers and communities, Exelon is ready to lead the energy transition to a cleaner and brighter future,” said Calvin Butler, Exelon president and CEO. “Our teams are focused on the things that matter to our customers: safety, reliability, sustainability and affordability, while ensuring our actions are grounded in taking an equitable and inclusive approach to the communities we serve. It’s a strong foundation for 2023 and beyond.”

“We delivered strong financial results in our first year as a new company,” said Jeanne Jones, executive vice president and CFO. “For the full year 2022, we earned $2.08 per share on a GAAP basis and $2.27 on a non-GAAP basis, results that are in the upper half of our guidance range. Over the next four years, Exelon will invest $31 billion to support our jurisdictions’ energy transitions, growing the rate base by 7.9%, and results in our expectations for 6% to 8% annualized growth in operating earnings per share through 2026, off the midpoint of our 2022 guidance. We expect adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings for 2023 of $2.30 - $2.42 per share, in line with the direction provided in our third-quarter earnings call.”

Fourth Quarter 2022

Exelon's GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased to $0.43 per share from $0.31 GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased to $0.43 per share from $0.39 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the reconciliations of GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations to Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings, refer to the tables beginning on page 5.

Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily reflect:

Full Year 2022

Exelon's GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations for 2022 increased to $2.08 per share from $1.65 GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations per share in 2021. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for 2022 increased to $2.27 per share from $1.83 per share in 2021.

Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the full year 2022 primarily reflect:

Operating Company Results1

ComEd

ComEd's fourth quarter of 2022 GAAP Net Income increased to $211 million from $133 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. ComEd's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased to $211 million from $138 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to increases in electric distribution formula rate earnings (reflecting higher allowed electric distribution ROE due to an increase in treasury rates and the impacts of higher rate base). Due to revenue decoupling, ComEd's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.

PECO

PECO’s fourth quarter of 2022 GAAP Net Income decreased to $102 million from $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. PECO's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 decreased to $102 million from $125 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to increases in depreciation expense, credit loss expense, and interest expense, partially offset by distribution rate increases.

BGE

BGE’s fourth quarter of 2022 GAAP Net Income decreased to $113 million from $117 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. BGE's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 decreased to $114 million from $121 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to an increase in various expenses, offset by favorable impacts of the multi-year plans. Due to revenue decoupling, BGE's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.

PHI

PHI’s fourth quarter of 2022 GAAP Net Income increased to $90 million from $26 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. PHI’s Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased to $90 million from $64 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to distribution rate increases, lower contracting costs, and timing of excess deferred tax amortization, partially offset by increases in depreciation expense and credit loss expense. Due to revenue decoupling, PHI's distribution earnings related to Pepco Maryland, DPL Maryland, Pepco District of Columbia, and ACE are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.

Initiates Annual Guidance for 2023

Exelon introduced a guidance range for 2023 Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings of $2.30-$2.42 per share. The outlook for 2023 Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for Exelon and its subsidiaries excludes costs related to the separation.

Note:
Amounts may not sum due to rounding.
Unless otherwise noted, the income tax impact of each reconciling item between GAAP Net Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is based on the marginal statutory federal and state income tax rates for each Registrant, taking into account whether the income or expense item is taxable or deductible, respectively, in whole or in part. For all items, the marginal statutory income tax rates for 2022 and 2021 ranged from 24.0% to 29.0%.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to net income as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), Exelon evaluates its operating performance using the measure of Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings because management believes it represents earnings directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, and other specified items. This measure is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of period over period operating results and provide an indication of Exelon’s baseline operating performance excluding items that are considered by management to be not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, this measure is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentation. Exelon has provided the non-GAAP financial measure as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings should not be deemed more useful than, a substitute for, or an alternative to the most comparable GAAP Net Income measures provided in this earnings release and attachments. This press release and earnings release attachments provide reconciliations of Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, are posted on Exelon’s website: www.exeloncorp.com, and have been furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K on Feb. 14, 2023.

Note:
Amounts may not sum due to rounding.
Unless otherwise noted, the income tax impact of each reconciling item between GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is based on the marginal statutory federal and state income tax rates for each Registrant, taking into account whether the income or expense item is taxable or deductible, respectively, in whole or in part. For all items, the marginal statutory income tax rates for 2022 and 2021 ranged from 24.0% to 29.0%.

(a)

Other primarily includes eliminating and consolidating adjustments, Exelon’s corporate operations, shared service entities, and other financing and investment activities.

(b)

For ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL Maryland, and ACE, customer rates are adjusted to eliminate the impacts of weather and customer usage on distribution volumes.

(c)

For regulatory recovery mechanisms, including ComEd’s distribution formula rate and energy efficiency formula, ComEd, PECO, BGE, and PHI utilities transmission formula rates, and riders across all utilities, revenues increase and decrease i) as fully recoverable costs fluctuate (with no impact on net earnings), and ii) pursuant to changes in rate base, capital structure and ROE (which impact net earnings).

(1)

Represents direct costs related to COVID-19 consisting primarily of costs to acquire personal protective equipment, costs for cleaning supplies and services, and costs to hire healthcare professionals to monitor the health of employees, which are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense.

(2)

Reflects costs related to a multi-year Enterprise Resource Program (ERP) system implementation, which are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense.

(3)

Represents costs related to the separation primarily comprised of system-related costs, third-party costs paid to advisors, consultants, lawyers, and other experts assisting in the separation, and employee-related severance costs, which are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense.

(4)

In 2021, for PHI, primarily reflects the recognition of a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset associated with Delaware net operating loss carryforwards due to a change in Delaware tax law. In 2022, for Corporate, in connection with the separation, Exelon recorded an income tax benefit related to deductible transaction costs.

(5)

Reflects costs related to the impairment of an office building at BGE, which are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense.

(6)

For ComEd, reflects increased distribution revenues due to higher allowed electric distribution ROE driven by an increase in treasury rates and higher rate base. For PECO, reflects increased revenue primarily due to distribution rate increases. For BGE, reflects increased revenue due to distribution rate increases. For PHI, reflects increased revenue primarily due to distribution rate increases.

(7)

For ComEd, reflects increased electric distribution, transmission, and energy efficiency revenues due to higher fully recoverable costs and increased revenues collected related to the Energy Transition Assistance Charge rider that are offset in Other. For PHI, includes the regulatory asset amortization of the ACE Purchase Power Agreement termination obligation recorded in the first quarter of 2022, which is fully recoverable.

(8)

Represents Operating and maintenance expense, excluding pension and non-pension postretirement benefits. For ComEd, primarily reflects the absence of the voluntary customer refund related to the ICC investigation of matters identified in the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. For PECO, includes higher contracting costs, an increase in charitable contributions, and an increase in credit loss expense. For BGE, primarily reflects an increase in charitable contributions. For PHI, primarily reflects lower contracting costs partially due to timing of maintenance projects. For Corporate, primarily reflects two offsetting items: 1) lower BSC costs that were historically allocated to Generation but are presented as part of continuing operations in Exelon’s results as these costs do not qualify as expenses of the discontinued operations per the accounting rules and 2) an increase in Operating and maintenance expense with an offsetting increase in other income for costs billed to Constellation for services provided by Exelon through the Transition Services Agreement (TSA). For Corporate, also reflects an increase in charitable contributions.

(9)

Reflects ongoing capital expenditures across all utilities. For ComEd, also reflects increased amortization of deferred energy efficiency costs. For PHI, also includes the regulatory asset amortization of the ACE Purchase Power Agreement termination obligation recorded in the first quarter of 2022, which is fully recoverable in Other Energy Delivery.

(10)

For ComEd, includes an increase in taxes related to the Energy Transition Assistance Charge rider which are fully recoverable in Other Energy Delivery. For PECO, includes an increase in interest expense. For PHI, reflects the timing of tax expense driven by the timing of excess deferred tax amortization, which reversed at year-end. For Corporate, primarily reflects an increase in other income for costs billed to Constellation for services provided by Exelon through the TSA with an offsetting increase in Operating and maintenance expense and an increase in interest expense.

(11)

Reflects the impact on earnings per share due to the increase in Exelon's average diluted common shares outstanding as a result of the August 2022 common stock issuance.
