Section 8- Other Events


Item 8.01. Other Events






On February 1, 2023, an ordinance is expected to be introduced to the Chicago City Council that, if approved, would (1) grant Commonwealth Edison Company ("ComEd") a new franchise agreement, or license ("New License"), to provide on a non-exclusive basis electric utility services using public ways within the City of Chicago, Illinois, and (2) authorize the City to enter into a related Energy and Equity Agreement ("EEA") with ComEd. The New License would have an initial 15-year term ending December 31, 2037 and, subject to mutual agreement reached on or before December 31, 2036, an additional five-year extension term ending December 31, 2042, and the EEA would have a term expiring December 31, 2042, or, if earlier, the expiration date of the New License.






Upon its effectiveness, the New License would replace the existing 1992 non-exclusive license from the City of Chicago under which ComEd currently provides electric utility service within the City of Chicago. The New License would cover, among other things, the use of the public ways and property, coordination of activities, permitting, relocation of utility facilities, undergrounding of overhead utility facilities, and reporting and information requirements. It also establishes certain utilization initiatives, including goals for participation by minority-owned and women-owned business enterprises and utilization of City of Chicago residents in certain non-electric grid projects. The New License would provide for compensation to be paid by ComEd to the City in the form of a franchise fee, recoverable from customers in the City, determined as prescribed by the Illinois Infrastructure Maintenance Fee Law.






The New License would grant the City the right, upon not less than one year's prior demand, which may not be given earlier than January 1, 2027, to acquire ComEd's utility facilities located in Chicago that provide electricity to customers within Chicago. That acquisition would require a cash consideration equal to: (a) the cost of reproduction new of those utility facilities, minus (b) the depreciation on those utility facilities, plus (c) the net actual costs of separating the utility facilities to be transferred to the City from other portions of ComEd's electric utility system, plus (d) a "Municipalization Increment", intended to recover a pro rata portion of contributions (assuming a 15-year pro ration period) made to the non-profit entity discussed below, net of any amounts recovered in utility rates or, in certain cases, third party sources.






Under the EEA, the parties would create a new non-profit entity to advance energy and energy-related equity projects. The non-profit would be governed by a seven-member board of directors, two of whom would be appointed by ComEd and five of whom would be appointed by the City of Chicago. No board member may be a current employee or director of Exelon Corporation or its affiliates.






Projects advanced by the non-profit would be funded, at least in part, by ComEd. ComEd would fund the non-profit in installments to be made between 2023 and 2026, in the aggregate amount of $90 million, with an additional $20 million funded if the City and ComEd allow the New License to enter the five-year extension term. Those fundings would not be recovered in rates charged to customers. Under the EEA, ComEd also would commit to funding not less than $10 million to establish workforce development initiatives with the intent of preparing individuals from disadvantaged communities for clean energy careers; provided that if ComEd recovered that $10 million in rates, it would make a further $10 million payment to the non-profit.






No assurance can be provided as to the nature or timing of any action that the Chicago City Council may take in connection with its consideration of the ordinance or as to the final terms of any New License or EEA.
