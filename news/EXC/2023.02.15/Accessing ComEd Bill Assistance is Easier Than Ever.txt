As challenging economic conditions persist, ComEd recognizes there are customers across northern Illinois in need of assistance with their electric bills. For this reason, ComEd reminds customers of its Smart Assistance Manager (SAM), an easy-to-use, online system that presents customers with a growing range of grants and bill-payment options that can keep them connected to safe and reliable electric service.

Tools like SAM build on ComEd’s work to manage costs, which has contributed to an average monthly customer bill of $93 that is among the lowest in the nation, and residential customer bills that are approximately 20 percent lower than the average for the 10 largest U.S. metropolitan areas.

“ComEd is proud to provide superior service and value to our customers, but we recognize that, while our bills are relatively low, some customers still struggle and need assistance,” said Nichole Owens, vice president of customer channels, ComEd. “That’s why we continually monitor economic conditions and enhance our assistance offerings to customers in need – whether a customer received help in the past or needs assistance for the first time. We created SAM so that customers had a one-stop-shop to easily sort through their options and connect with the solutions that best fit their needs.”

By accessing SAM at ComEd.com/SAM, customers can simply key in a few details about their home, such as energy usage and billing history. SAM then does the work of sorting through the many options available and matches customers with the payment-assistance programs for which they may eligible now, and provides recommendations on energy-efficiency offerings that can save customers money and energy into the future.

By accessing SAM, customers can receive information – and be connected to – support and savings programs such as:
