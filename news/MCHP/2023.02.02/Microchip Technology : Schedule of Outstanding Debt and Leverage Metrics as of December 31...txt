Disclosure Regarding adjusted EBITDA as a Non-GAAPFinancial Measure: Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and the above calculation of adjusted EBITDA is based on the definition in our Credit Agreement. In the above table, adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to Net Income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our calculation of adjusted EBITDA might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with the use of adjusted EBITDA, including that it excludes financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. We compensate for this by presenting such information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and providing a reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.
