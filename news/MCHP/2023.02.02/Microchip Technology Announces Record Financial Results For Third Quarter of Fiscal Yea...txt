CHANDLER, Ariz., Feb.  02, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (NASDAQ: MCHP) - Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of smart, connected, and secure embedded control solutions, today reported results for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as summarized in the table below.(1) In millions, except per share amounts and percentages of net sales.(2) See the "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section of this release.Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 were a record $2.169 billion, up 23.4% from net sales of $1.758 billion in the prior year's third fiscal quarter.GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was $580.3 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, up from GAAP net income of $352.8 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, in the prior year's third fiscal quarter. For the third quarters of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, GAAP net income was adversely impacted by amortization of acquired intangible assets associated with our previous acquisitions.Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was a record at $863.7 million, or $1.56 per diluted share, up from non-GAAP net income of $681.7 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, in the prior year's third fiscal quarter. For the third quarters of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, severance, and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition), professional services associated with certain legal matters, non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures and losses on the settlement of debt. For the third quarters of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, our non-GAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the applicable fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.Microchip announced today that its Board of Directors declared a record quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 35.8 cents per share, up 9.1% from the cash dividend paid last quarter and up 41.5% from the year ago quarter. The quarterly dividend is payable on March 7, 2023 to stockholders of record on February 21, 2023."We are pleased to report our 9th consecutive revenue growth quarter and another quarter of record operating profit and net income," said Ganesh Moorthy, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our fiscal third quarter revenue grew 4.6% sequentially and 23.4% year-over-year to $2.17 billion. Non-GAAP operating margins came in at 47.5%, which was ahead of our guidance range and above the high-end of our long-term operating model. Our consistent results demonstrate our team's relentless focus on operational excellence, which we believe positions us well to capture market share gains over the business cycle."Mr. Moorthy added, "Supply is gradually improving, and for the first time in nine quarters we were able to modestly reduce our large unsupported backlog. We are starting to see improvements in lead times in select technology corridors and remain focused on strategically reducing our unsupported backlog in a disciplined manner, while preserving the quality of the new backlog that gets placed. With gradual supply improvements, we are aiming to better serve our customers by targeting lead times for most of our products to be 26 weeks or less by the second half of 2023. In addition, China's zero COVID policy, and the after-effects of their subsequent rapid lifting of lock-downs, resulted in disruptions which drove higher-than-normal inventory at customers and distributors. We remain cautiously optimistic that we can deliver a soft landing for our business and expect our operating metrics to once again demonstrate resiliency through this business cycle."Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair, said, “Microchip's Board of Directors approved a sequential increase in our dividend of 9.1% to a record 35.8 cents per share, which represents a 41.5% year-over-year increase. Given our strong cash flow generation during the December quarter, we are targeting to return $469.8 million to our shareholders in the March quarter through dividends and share repurchases, representing 62.5% of our adjusted free cash flow in the December quarter. Our adjusted cash flow excludes $385 million that we collected from our customers or paid to suppliers for long-term supply assurance payments. We are adjusting for these payments since they are refundable when customers fulfill their purchase commitments. Our board remains committed to increasing cash returns to shareholders, and we are announcing today that since we expect to exit the March quarter with our net leverage below 1.5X we will accelerate the percentage of free cash flow returned. Under this program, starting with the June quarter, we expect to increase the percentage of adjusted free cash flow we return to shareholders every quarter by 500 basis points, until we reach 100% of adjusted free cash flow returned which is targeted to occur in approximately eight quarters. Therefore in the June 2023 quarter we now expect to return 67.5% of our adjusted free cash flow from the March quarter to shareholders."Eric Bjornholt, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, said, "We continued to aggressively pay down our debt with another $719.1 million of payments during the December quarter, reflecting a cumulative debt pay down of almost $6.2 billion over the past 18 quarters, as we have actively managed the working capital requirements for the business. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.56x for the December quarter. In addition, our capital return strategy is expected to give us the flexibility to continue to pay down high-interest debt. Our operating model has been a strong cash generator and is demonstrating significant operating leverage as we continue on our Microchip 3.0 journey."Mr. Moorthy concluded, "Our backlog for the March quarter is strong and we have more capacity improvements coming into effect. However, we are also taking active steps to help customers with inventory positions to selectively push out some of their backlog. Considering these factors and the economic backdrop, we expect net sales in the March quarter to be up between 1% and 4% sequentially, and we expect to grow revenue sequentially again in the June quarter. At the mid-point of our guidance for the March quarter, net sales would be 20.6% higher than the year-ago quarter."Microchip's Highlights for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2022:Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Outlook:The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.(1) See the "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section of this release for information regarding our non-GAAP guidance.(2) We are not able to estimate the amount of certain Special Charges and Other, net that may be incurred during the quarter ending March 31, 2023. Therefore, our estimate of GAAP operating expenses excludes certain amounts that may be recognized as Special Charges and Other, net in the quarter ending March 31, 2023.(3) The forecast for GAAP tax expense excludes any unexpected tax events that may occur during the quarter, as these amounts cannot be forecasted.(4) Represents the expected cash tax rate for fiscal 2023, excluding any transition tax payments associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Under the GAAP revenue recognition standard, which we adopted on April 1, 2018, we are required to recognize revenue when control of the product changes from us to a customer or distributor. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on creating demand for our products in the end markets we serve and not on moving inventory into our distribution network. We also manage our manufacturing and supply chain operations, including our distributor relationships, towards the goal of having our products available at the time and location the end customer desires.Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Our non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, severance, and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition), professional services associated with certain legal matters, non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures and losses on the settlement of debt. For the third quarters of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, our non-GAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units, and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. Our other non-GAAP adjustments are either non-cash expenses, unusual or infrequent items, or other expenses related to transactions. Management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.We are using non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars, including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP other expense, net, and non-GAAP income tax rate, which exclude the items noted above, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of our business and for compensation purposes. We also use our non-GAAP results when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. Our determination of these non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using these non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.Generally, gross margin fluctuates over time, driven primarily by the mix of products sold and licensing revenue; variances in manufacturing yields; fixed cost absorption; wafer fab loading levels; costs of wafers from foundries; inventory reserves; pricing pressures in our non-proprietary product lines; and competitive and economic conditions. Operating expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to net sales and profit levels.Diluted Common Shares Outstanding can vary for, among other things, the trading price of our common stock, the exercise of options or vesting of restricted stock units, the potential for incremental dilutive shares from our convertible debentures (additional information regarding our share count is available in the investor relations section of our website under the heading "Supplemental Financial Information"), and repurchases or issuances of shares of our common stock. The diluted common shares outstanding presented in the guidance table above assumes an average Microchip stock price in the March 2023 quarter between $75 and $80 per share (however, we make no prediction as to what our actual share price will be for such period or any other period and we cannot estimate what our stock option exercise activity will be during the quarter).MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIESCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(in millions, except per share amounts; unaudited)MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIESCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(in millions; unaudited)MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIESRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES(in millions, except per share amounts and percentages; unaudited)RECONCILIATION OF GAAP GROSS PROFIT TO NON-GAAP GROSS PROFITRECONCILIATION OF GAAP RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES TO NON-GAAP RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSESRECONCILIATION OF GAAP SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TO NON-GAAP SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSESRECONCILIATION OF GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES TO NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSESRECONCILIATION OF GAAP OPERATING INCOME TO NON-GAAP OPERATING INCOMERECONCILIATION OF GAAP OTHER EXPENSE, NET TO NON-GAAP OTHER EXPENSE, NETRECONCILIATION OF GAAP INCOME TAX PROVISION TO NON-GAAP INCOME TAX PROVISIONRECONCILIATION OF GAAP NET INCOME AND GAAP DILUTED NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE TO NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND NON-GAAP DILUTED NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARERECONCILIATION OF GAAP CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO FREE CASH FLOWMicrochip will host a conference call today, February 2, 2023 at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) to discuss this release.
