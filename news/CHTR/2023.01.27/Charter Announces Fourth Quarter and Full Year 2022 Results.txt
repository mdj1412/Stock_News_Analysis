Footnotes - In thousands, except per customer and penetration data. See footnotes to unaudited summary of operating statistics on page 6 of the addendum of this news release. The footnotes contain important disclosures regarding the definitions used for these operating statistics.  All percentages are calculated using whole numbers. Minor differences may exist due to rounding.
As of December 31, 2022, Charter had 30.0 million residential customer relationships.
Fourth quarter residential Internet customers increased by 92,000, compared to an increase of 172,000 customers during the fourth quarter of 2021. Spectrum Internet® delivers the fastest speeds in Charter's footprint.1 Charter offers Spectrum Internet products with speeds up to 1 Gbps across its entire footprint. Charter's Advanced WiFi, a managed WiFi service that provides customers an optimized home network while providing greater control of their connected devices with enhanced security and privacy, is available to nearly all Spectrum Internet customers. In October 2022, Charter introduced Spectrum One, which brings together Spectrum Internet, Advanced WiFi and Unlimited Spectrum MobileTM, to offer consumers faster, more reliable and secure online connections on their favorite devices at home and on the go in a high-value package.
Residential video customers decreased by 145,000 in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to a decline of 71,000 in the fourth quarter of 2021. As of December 31, 2022, Charter had 14.5 million residential video customers.

Fourth quarter 2022 residential revenue per residential customer (excluding mobile) totaled $114.20, and increased by 0.1% compared to the prior year period, given promotional rate step-ups and rate adjustments, partly offset by a higher mix of non-video customer relationships and a higher mix of lower priced video packages within Charter's video customer base.

Revenues
Fourth quarter revenue increased by 3.5% year-over-year to $13.7 billion, driven primarily by growth in mobile, advertising sales and commercial revenues.
Residential revenue totaled $10.3 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 0.4% year-over-year.
Internet revenue grew by 3.9% year-over-year to $5.6 billion, driven by growth in Internet customers during the last year, promotional rate step-ups, reduced bundled discounts and rate adjustments, partly offset by lower bundled revenue allocation.
Video revenue totaled $4.3 billion in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 3.5% compared to the prior year period, driven by a higher mix of lower priced video packages within Charter's video customer base and a decline in video customers during the last year, partly offset by promotional rate step-ups and video rate adjustments that pass through programmer rate increases.
Voice revenue totaled $379 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 4.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by a decline in wireline voice customers over the last twelve months, partly offset by voice rate adjustments.
Commercial revenue increased by 3.3% year-over-year to $1.8 billion, driven by SMB and enterprise revenue growth of 2.4% and 4.9% year-over-year, respectively. Fourth quarter 2022 SMB revenue growth was driven by customer relationship growth. Enterprise revenue excluding wholesale increased by 9.1% year-over-year, mostly reflecting PSU growth.
Fourth quarter advertising sales revenue of $558 million increased by 24.6% compared to the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by higher political revenue. Excluding political revenue in both periods, advertising sales revenue decreased by 3.4% year-over-year, due to lower local and national advertising revenue, partly offset by higher advanced advertising revenue.
Fourth quarter mobile revenue totaled $876 million, an increase of 38.7% year-over-year, driven by mobile line growth.
Operating Costs and Expenses
Fourth quarter programming costs decreased by $95 million, or 3.3% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, reflecting fewer video customers and a higher mix of lower cost packages within Charter's video customer base, partly offset by contractual programming rate increases and renewals.
Regulatory, connectivity and produced content expenses decreased by $31 million, or 5.3% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower regulatory and franchise fees and lower video CPE sold to customers.
Costs to service customers increased by $108 million, or 5.8% year-over-year. The year-over-year increase in costs to service customers was primarily driven by adjustments to job structure, pay and benefits to build a more skilled and longer tenured workforce, higher fuel and freight costs and higher bad debt, partly offset by productivity improvements. Costs to service customers excluding bad debt increased by 4.9% year-over-year.
Marketing expenses increased by $55 million, or 6.9% year-over-year, due to higher staffing levels and wages as Charter focuses on providing better service to new and existing customers.
Fourth quarter mobile costs totaled $982 million, an increase of 35.7% year-over-year, and were comprised of device costs, customer acquisition costs and service and operating costs.
Other expenses increased by $64 million, or 6.6% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to higher labor costs and higher advertising sales expense related to higher political revenue.
Net Income Attributable to Charter Shareholders
Net income attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. The year-over-year decrease in net income attributable to Charter shareholders was primarily driven by higher income tax expense, higher interest expense, net and the change in other income (expense), net, partly offset by higher Adjusted EBITDA. 
Net income per basic common share attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $7.79 in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $9.17 during the same period last year. The decrease was primarily the result of the factors described above, partly offset by the benefit of a 12.6% decrease in basic weighted average common shares outstanding versus the prior year period.
Adjusted EBITDA
Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $5.5 billion grew by 1.9% year-over-year, reflecting growth in revenue and operating expenses of 3.5% and 4.6%, respectively.
Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures totaled $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $2.1 billion during the fourth quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher spend on line extensions, which totaled $928 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $451 million in the prior year quarter, driven by Charter's rural construction initiative. Fourth quarter capital expenditures excluding line extensions totaled $2.0 billion, compared to $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by investment in network evolution, higher customer premise equipment spend on Advanced WiFi equipment and timing of spend.
Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow
During the fourth quarter of 2022, net cash flows from operating activities totaled $3.8 billion, compared to $4.2 billion in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year decrease in net cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to higher cash taxes.
Free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2022 totaled $1.1 billion, compared to $2.3 billion during the same period last year. The year-over-year decrease in free cash flow was primarily driven by a decrease in net cash flows from operating activities and an increase in capital expenditures.
Liquidity & Financing
As of December 31, 2022, total principal amount of debt was $97.4 billion and Charter's credit facilities provided approximately $4.0 billion of additional liquidity in excess of Charter's $645 million cash position.
Share Repurchases
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, Charter purchased 3.6 million shares of Charter Class A common stock and Charter Holdings common units for approximately $1.3 billion.

Revenues
For the year ended December 31, 2022, revenues increased to $54.0 billion, 4.5% higher than in 2021, driven primarily by growth in residential, mobile and advertising sales revenues.
Operating Costs and Expenses
Operating costs and expenses totaled $32.4 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 4.4% compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by increases in mobile, costs to service customers and marketing expenses. 
Net Income Attributable to Charter Shareholders
Net income attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $5.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $4.7 billion in 2021. The year-over-year increase in net income attributable to Charter shareholders was primarily driven by higher Adjusted EBITDA, partly offset by higher income tax expense.
Net income per basic common share attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $31.30 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $25.34 during the same period last year. The increase was primarily the result of the factors described above in addition to a 12.1% decrease in weighted average common shares outstanding versus the prior year period.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA totaled $21.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 4.8% compared to 2021, reflecting growth in revenue and operating expenses of 4.5% and 4.4%, respectively. 
Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures totaled $9.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $7.6 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher spend on line extensions, which totaled $3.0 billion in 2022, driven by Charter's rural construction initiative. For the full year 2022, capital expenditures excluding line extensions totaled $6.4 billion.
Charter currently expects full year 2023 capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, to be between $6.5 billion and $6.8 billion. Charter expects 2023 line extensions capital expenditures to approximate $4 billion. The actual amount of capital expenditures in 2023 will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the pace of Charter's network evolution and rural construction initiatives, supply chain timing and growth rates in Charter's residential and commercial businesses.
Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow
For the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash flows from operating activities totaled $14.9 billion, compared to $16.2 billion in 2021. The year-over-year decrease in net cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to higher cash taxes, higher cash paid for interest and the payment of litigation settlements, partly offset by an increase in Adjusted EBITDA.
Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $6.1 billion, compared to $8.7 billion during the same period last year. The year-over-year decrease in free cash flow was driven by a decrease in net cash flows from operating activities and an increase in capital expenditures.
Share Repurchases
During the year ended December 31, 2022, Charter purchased 23.8 million shares of Charter Class A common stock and Charter Holdings common units, or 12.0% of fully diluted shares outstanding (including as-exchanged Charter Holdings common units) as of December 31, 2021, for approximately $11.7 billion.

Additional Information Available on Website
The information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which will be posted on the "Results & SEC Filings" section of the Company's investor relations website at ir.charter.com, when it is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). A slide presentation to accompany the conference call and a trending schedule containing historical customer and financial data will also be available in the "Results & SEC Filings" section.
Use of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow Information
The Company uses certain measures that are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") to evaluate various aspects of its business. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income attributable to Charter shareholders and net cash flows from operating activities reported in accordance with GAAP. These terms, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are reconciled to net income attributable to Charter shareholders and net cash flows from operating activities, respectively, in the Addendum to this release.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Charter shareholders plus net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, other income (expenses), net and other operating (income) expenses, net, such as special charges and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. As such, it eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of the Company's businesses as well as other non-cash or special items, and is unaffected by the Company's capital structure or investment activities. However, this measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and the cash cost of financing. These costs are evaluated through other financial measures.     
Free cash flow is defined as net cash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditures and changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures.   
Management and Charter's board of directors use Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to assess Charter's performance and its ability to service its debt, fund operations and make additional investments with internally generated funds. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA generally correlates to the leverage ratio calculation under the Company's credit facilities or outstanding notes to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the facilities and notes (all such documents have been previously filed with the SEC). For the purpose of calculating compliance with leverage covenants, the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, excluding certain expenses paid by its operating subsidiaries to other Charter entities. The Company's debt covenants refer to these expenses as management fees, which were $355 million and $352 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

(a)
We calculate the aging of customer accounts based on the monthly billing cycle for each account.  On that basis, at December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, customers included approximately 144,100, 151,700 and 128,300 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 60 days past due, approximately 52,800, 55,500 and 26,800 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 90 days past due and approximately 214,100, 149,300 and 43,200 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 120 days past due.  Bad debt expense associated with these past due accounts has been reflected in our consolidated statements of operations.  The increase in past due accounts is predominately due to pre-existing and incremental unsubsidized services, including video services, for those customers participating in government assistance programs.  These customers are downgraded to a fully subsidized Internet-only service.
(b)
Passings represent our estimate of the number of units, such as single family homes, apartment and condominium units and SMB and enterprise sites passed by our cable distribution network in the areas where we offer the service indicated.  These estimates are based upon the information available at this time and are updated for all periods presented when new information becomes available. 
(c)
Customer relationships include the number of customers that receive one or more levels of service, encompassing Internet, video and voice services, without regard to which service(s) such customers receive.  Customers who reside in residential multiple dwelling units ("MDUs") and that are billed under bulk contracts are counted based on the number of billed units within each bulk MDU.  Total customer relationships exclude enterprise and mobile-only customer relationships.
(d)
Penetration represents residential and SMB customers as a percentage of estimated passings.  Penetration excludes mobile-only customers.
(e)
Monthly residential revenue per residential customer is calculated as total residential quarterly revenue divided by three divided by average residential customer relationships during the respective quarter and excludes mobile revenue and customers.
(f)
Monthly SMB revenue per SMB customer is calculated as total SMB quarterly revenue divided by three divided by average SMB customer relationships during the respective quarter and excludes mobile revenue and customers.
(g)
Single play, double play and triple play penetration represents the number of residential single play, double play and triple play cable customers, respectively, as a percentage of residential customer relationships, excluding mobile.
(h)
Mobile lines include phones and tablets which require one of our standard rate plans (e.g., "Unlimited" or "By the Gig").  Mobile lines exclude wearables and other devices that do not require standard phone rate plans.
(i)
Enterprise PSUs represents the aggregate number of fiber service offerings counting each separate service offering at each customer location as an individual PSU.
