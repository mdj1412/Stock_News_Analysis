With Quext IoT as its preferred smart apartment solution, Charter will further bolster its Spectrum Community Solutions services for multifamily properties by strategically offering Quext IoT’s smart apartment technology with its Advanced Community WiFi solutions. This will give building residents the ability to remotely manage smart-home devices such as apartment door locks and thermostats. The arrangement also enables Quext to expand its market. Charter’s Spectrum Community Solutions, which operates across 41 states, brings tremendous sales reach and scale.

"Our new teaming agreement with Quext allows us to recommend smart IoT solutions to our multifamily communities,” said Keith Dardis, Senior Vice President of Spectrum Community Solutions at Charter. “We can now pair our superior connectivity solutions with the most innovative IoT smart home technology. Together, these products offer a complimentary solution to increase net operating income.”

Spectrum Community Solutions Improves Quality of Life with Quext Smart Home and Apartment Innovative Technology

Quext IoT’s patented solution has proven an innovative approach to smart apartment technology in a number of ways. Invented and developed by multifamily owners and operators, its design requires significantly less hardware and capital investment to implement and maintain. As operators themselves, Quext designed its solution with a focus on operational efficiencies, addressing real pain points like reducing onsite hardware, improving lock battery life, and remote lock credentialing to minimize maintenance calls and disruption. And, due to its unique network design, Quext IoT is an ideal solution for both existing property retrofits and new construction of all classes.

"We are tremendously honored that Charter has chosen Quext IoT as its preferred smart home solution in the multifamily space. Our teams are so closely aligned in both our telecom and multifamily industry experience. Teaming with Spectrum will help both organizations to deploy affordable, highly desirable and valuable products on their properties," said Dave Gilles, CEO of Quext. "This agreement tremendously benefits owners and operators in the multifamily industry, their investors and residents as well."

The agreement represents a significant sales and marketing alliance allowing the Spectrum Community Solutions sales team to offer multi-unit property owners two of the industry’s most in-demand amenities – Bulk Internet/WiFi and Smart Home/IoT. Together, WiFi and smart home automation allow both organizations the ability to rapidly scale while providing added value to more customers. Advantages and benefits include:

Charter’s teaming agreement with Quext is currently available to new and existing Spectrum Community Solutions customers in Texas and Florida, and will be offered to customers throughout Charter’s footprint in the coming months.
