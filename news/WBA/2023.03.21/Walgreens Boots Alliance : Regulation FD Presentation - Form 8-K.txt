        While the unaudited supplemental financial information of Summit Health-CityMD does not reflect any cost savings or operating synergies that the combined company may realize or incur as a result of the Summit Health-CityMD Acquisition, management has included estimates of certain projected pre-taxrun-rate cost savings and operating synergies expected to be realized in the table above for further transparency of the acquisition impacts. Synergies include future expected cost savings resulting from procurement, workforce optimization, process improvements, and automation as well as future expected operating synergies resulting from Summit Health-CityMD's transition to risk-based contracting. Material limitations of these run-rate synergies include not fully realizing the anticipated benefits, taking longer to realize these benefits, or other adverse effects that the Company does not currently foresee. Cost savings and operating synergies targets are subject to significant estimates and judgement and actual synergies achieved by the Company in the future may vary.

These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein.

              Acquisition-related amortization includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, inventory valuation adjustments and stock-based compensation fair valuation adjustments. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets includes amortization of intangible assets such as customer relationships, trade names, trademarks, developed technology and contract intangibles. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP measure represents the entire amount recorded within Summit Health-CityMD's GAAP financial statements. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP measures. Amortization expense, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired, or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. These charges are primarily recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. The stock-based compensation fair valuation adjustment reflects the difference between the fair value based remeasurement of awards under purchase accounting and the grant date fair valuation. Post-acquisition compensation expense recognized in excess of the original grant date fair value of acquiree awards are excluded from the related non-GAAP measures as these arise from acquisition-related accounting requirements or agreements, and are not reflective of normal operating activities.

              Acquisition-related costs are transaction and integration costs associated with certain merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities. These costs include charges incurred related to certain mergers, acquisition and divestitures related activities recorded in operating income, for example, costs related to integration efforts for merger, acquisition and divestitures activities. Examples of such costs include deal costs, severance and stock compensation. These charges are primarily recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs are significantly impacted by the timing and complexity of the underlying merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities and do not reflect Summit Health-CityMD's current operating performance.

              Includes GAAP stock-based compensation expense excluding expenses related to acquisition-related amortization and acquisition-related costs.
