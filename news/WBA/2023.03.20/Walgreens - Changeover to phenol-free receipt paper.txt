Walgreens Boots Alliance is committed to building a better and healthier world, which starts by making a difference in the communities we serve.Our decision to changeover to phenol-free paper receipts is an important step that very much supports these efforts. We are continuing this transition through a phased approach, which began with all of our Boots locations in the UK, and we are now working to complete the changeover to phenol-free receipts at all of our nearly 9,000 Walgreens and Duane Reade stores in the U.S. by the end of 2023.Previously, in 2020, Walgreens also began offering a completely 'no contact' checkout option for customers, including the ability to receive digital only receipts. Currently, this step alone is saving 87 miles of receipt paper every day.Contact:Email: media@walgreens.comTel: 847-315-2921(C) 2023 Electronic News Publishing, source ENP Newswire
