Jan 5 (Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance said
on Thursday it will not strike new deals in the short term after
a spate of acquisitions in recent years, as it focuses on
ramping up sales at its newer healthcare business.The company, one of the largest U.S. pharmacies, has been
looking to gain a bigger foothold in the healthcare space at a
time when sales at its traditional brick-and-mortar stores are
hit by lower demand for COVID-19 vaccines and testing compared
to last-year's peak."We're not considering any M&A type activity in the
short term. We're taking a pause. We need to focus on
integration activities," Chief Financial Officer James Kehoe
said in a post-earnings conference call.The company could still make targeted acquisitions, but
those would likely be in the hundreds of millions of dollars
range, Kehoe said.Shares of the company fell over 6% after same-store
sales at its pharmacy business missed expectations in the first
quarter, and as it reported a quarterly loss versus a year-ago
profit due to a $6.5 billion opioid-related litigation charge.Walgreens spent $5.5 billion in 2021 to take majority stakes
in healthcare providers VillageMD and CareCentrix, and VillageMD
later struck a $9 billion deal to buy urgent care provider
Summit Health in November 2022.Pharmacy sales during the quarter dropped about 4% even amid
high demand for cough and cold drugs during one of the worst
U.S. flu seasons in a decade.Walgreens said same-store pharmacy sales rose 4.8% in the
reported quarter from a year earlier, but below Evercore ISI's
estimates of 5% growth.Comparisons from last year when there was a COVID surge are
"masking some positive changes we are seeing with Walgreens
building its U.S. Healthcare business and improvements the
company has made in its drugstores post-pandemic," Edward Jones
analyst John Boylan said.Net loss attributable to Walgreens was $3.72 billion, for
the quarter ended Nov. 30, compared with a profit of $3.58
billion, a year earlier.
