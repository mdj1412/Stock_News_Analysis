Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: ROST) today reported earnings per share for the fourth quarter ended January 28, 2023 of $1.31 on net income of $447 million. These results compare to earnings per share of $1.04 on net earnings of $367 million for the 13 weeks ended January 29, 2022. Sales for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $5.2 billion, with comparable store sales up 1% on top of a 9% increase for the same period in 2021.

For the 2022 fiscal year ended January 28, 2023, earnings per share were $4.38 on net income of $1.5 billion, compared to $4.87 per share on net earnings of $1.7 billion in 2021. Sales for 2022 were $18.7 billion, versus $18.9 billion in fiscal 2021, with comparable store sales down 4%, versus a robust 13% increase in the prior year.

Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “During a very competitive holiday season, fourth quarter sales and earnings exceeded our guidance due to customers’ positive response to our improved assortments and stronger value offerings.”

She continued, “Fourth quarter operating margin was 10.7% compared to 9.8% in 2021. This improvement was mainly driven by lower freight and incentive costs that were partially offset by unfavorable timing of packaway-related expenses.”

Update on Shareholder Payouts

During the fourth quarter and fiscal 2022, the Company repurchased a total of 2.1 million and 10.3 million shares of common stock, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of $231 million in the quarter and $950 million for the fiscal year. These purchases were made pursuant to the two-year $1.9 billion program announced in March 2022. We expect to complete the $950 million remaining under this authorization in fiscal 2023.

The Company’s Board of Directors also recently increased the quarterly cash dividend by 8% to $0.335 per share to be payable on March 31, 2023 to stockholders of record as of March 14, 2023.

Ms. Rentler noted, “Our stock repurchase and dividend programs reflect our continued commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns, as well as our confidence in the Company’s projected future cash flows and the strength of our balance sheet.”

Fiscal 2023 Outlook

Looking ahead, Ms. Rentler noted, “As we enter 2023, the macroeconomic and geopolitical environments remain highly uncertain. As a result, we believe it is prudent to remain conservative when planning our business.”

She continued, “While we hope to do better, for the 52 weeks ending January 27, 2024, we are planning comparable store sales to be relatively flat versus a 4% decline and a 13% gain in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. If sales perform in line with this plan, we expect earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2024 to be $4.65 to $4.95 compared to $4.38 in fiscal 2022. Incorporated in this guidance range is an estimated benefit to earnings per share of approximately $0.15 from the 53rd week in fiscal 2023.”

Ms. Rentler added, “With elevated inflation continuing to impact our low-to-moderate income customer, we are also planning comparable store sales to be relatively flat for the 13 weeks ending April 29, 2023. This compares to a 7% decrease and a 13% gain in the first quarters of 2022 and 2021, respectively. If sales perform within this range, we expect earnings per share for the first quarter of 2023 to be $0.99 to $1.05 versus $0.97 last year.”

Ms. Rentler concluded, “Looking ahead, we will continue strengthening our merchandise assortments by delivering great branded bargains to the consumer while also strictly controlling expenses throughout the Company. This will allow us to maximize sales and profitability in 2023 and beyond.”
