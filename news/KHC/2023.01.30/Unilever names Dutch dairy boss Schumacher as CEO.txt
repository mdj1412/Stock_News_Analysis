LONDON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Consumer goods giant Unilever
on Monday appointed Hein Schumacher to replace Alan
Jope as chief executive from July 1 in a move that was welcomed
by board member and activist shareholder Nelson Peltz.Schumacher, 51, joined Unilever in October last year as
non-executive director and is currently the chief of Dutch dairy
business FrieslandCampina. His appointment marks the first time
Unilever has given the top job to a non-Unilever executive since
it poached Paul Polman from Nestle in 2008.Unilever, One of the biggest consumer companies in the world
with more than 400 brands ranging from detergent to ice cream,
said in September said that Jope planned to retire at the end of
2023.Schumacher, who was formerly at Royal Ahold NV, also worked
for H.J. Heinz for a decade across the United States, Europe and
Asia.Billionaire activist investor Nelson Peltz, who heads
investor Trian Partners, said he strongly supports Schumacher
"as our new CEO and look(s) forward to working closely with him
to drive significant sustainable stakeholder value." Peltz
become a Unilever board member in July after it was revealed
early last year that he had built a stake in the company."I first met Hein when I served as a director at the H.J.
Heinz Company from 2006 to 2013 and was impressed by his
leadership skills and business acumen," Peltz said.Peltz, through his Trian Fund, holds a nearly 1.5% stake in
Unilever, making him the fourth largest shareholder, according
to Refinitiv Eikon data.Unilever had been considering internal and external
candidates for the role.Sources told Reuters in October that the candidates included
finance chief Graeme Pitkethly, personal care division boss
Fabian Garcia and Hanneke Faber, who heads the company's
nutrition group."It is good Schumacher has plenty of industry experience
outside Unilever, particularly international," said Tineke
Frikee, a fund manager at Unilever shareholder Waverton
Investment Management."I note though that his background is mainly in food, rather
than beauty and personal care. This may lead the market to
reduce the probability of a potential food spin-off."Unilever's food business includes Ben & Jerry's ice cream,
Colman's mustard, Hellman's mayonnaise and Knorr stock cubes.Some investors and analysts have speculated over the past
year that Unilever might spin off what they feel is a weaker
food business to focus on personal goods, beauty and home care.Analysts at Jefferies and RBC Capital welcomed Unilever's
appointment of an external CEO, saying investors will support
the move."We think Unilever needs a cultural and organizational
shake-up," RBC analyst James Edwardes Jones wrote in a note.Schumacher brings "frontline experience," analysts at
Jefferies said.
