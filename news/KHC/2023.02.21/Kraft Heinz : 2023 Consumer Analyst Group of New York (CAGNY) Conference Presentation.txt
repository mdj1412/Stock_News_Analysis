        FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
      

        FEBRUARY 21, 2023
      

        This presentation contains a number of forward-looking statements as defined under U.S. federal securities laws, including, but not limited to, statements, estimates, and projections relating to our business and long-term strategy; our ambitions, goals, targets, and commitments; our activities, efforts, initiatives, plans, and programs, and our investments in such activities, efforts, initiatives, plans, and programs; and projected or expected timing, results, achievement, and impacts. W ords such as "aim," "anticipate," "aspire," "believe," "could,"
      

        "estimate," "expect," "guidance," "intend," "may," "might," "outlook," "plan," "predict," "project," "seek," "will," "would," and variations of such words and similar future or conditional expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's beliefs, expectations, estimates, and projections at the time they are
      

        made and are not guarantees of future performance. Such statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. For additional, important information regarding such risks and uncertainties, please see our earnings release, which accompanies this presentation, and the risk factors set forth in Kraft Heinz's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. We disclaim and do not undertake any obligation to update, revise, or withdraw any forward-looking statement in this presentation, except as required by applicable law or regulation.
      

        NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
      

        This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, Constant Currency Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, Net Leverage, Free Cash Flow, and Free Cash Flow Conversion. These non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. These measures are not substitutes for their comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
      

        United States of America ("GAAP") and should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the GAAP results.
      

        These non-GAAP financial measures assist management in comparing the Company's performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's underlying operations.
      

        Please view this presentation together with our associated earnings release, Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the accompanying non-GAAP information, which includes a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures, available on our website at ir.kraftheinzcompany.comunder News & Events > Events & Webcasts, or directly at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com/events-and-webcasts.
