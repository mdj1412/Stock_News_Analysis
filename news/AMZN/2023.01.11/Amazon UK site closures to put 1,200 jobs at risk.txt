AMAZON yesterday revealed plans to shut three UK warehouses in a move which will impact 1,200 jobs.The company has launched consultations over the closure of sites in Hemel Hempstead, Doncaster and Gourock, in the west of Scotland.All 1,200 workers at these sites will be offered roles at other Amazon locations, the firm said.The online technology giant has also revealed plans for two new major fulfilment centres in Peddimore and Stockton-on-Tees, which will create 2,500 jobs over the next three years.Around 500 employees currently work at Amazon's Hemel Hempstead site, and will all be offered roles at its nearby Dunstable warehouse or other nearby locations.The consultations will involve around 400 staff at its Doncaster site in Balby Carr Bank, who the company plans to transfer to its two other fulfilment centres at Doncaster's iPort.The proposals will also affect around 300 workers based at the Gourock site.Furthermore, Amazon said last night that it was closing seven of its delivery stations across the UK.Five stations in Huntingdon, Horley, Birmingham, Newcastle and Hemel Hempstead will close, with staff given the opportunity to transfer to stations in the local area.Also stations in Portsmouth and Aylesford will shut, with Amazon planning to open new delivery stations in Havant and Aylesford that staff can move to. Each of these sites employ a few dozen workers at most.It is understood these proposals are separate from Amazon's plan to cut around 18,000 jobs worldwide as part of a drive to cut costs.A spokesman for the company said: "All employees affected by site closure consultations will be offered the opportunity to transfer to other facilities, and we remain committed to our customers, employees, and communities across the UK."Steve Garelick, GMB union organiser, describes the plans as a "kick in the teeth" for Amazon workers.PA(c) 2023 City A.M., source Newspaper
