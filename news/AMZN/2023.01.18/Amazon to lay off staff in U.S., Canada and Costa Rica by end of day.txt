Jan 18 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc will cut some
jobs in the United States, Canada and Costa Rica by the end of
Wednesday as part of its plan to lay off 18,000 employees, the
e-commerce giant said in a memo to staff seen by Reuters.The layoffs are the latest in the U.S. technology sector,
with companies cutting their bloated workforce and slashing
costs to reverse pandemic-era excesses and prepare for a
worsening global economy.The company is terminating 2,300 employees in Seattle and
Bellevue, according to an update on the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification (WARN) site. The U.S. labor law requires
companies planning a mass layoff to inform employees 60 days
before the closure.Amazon.com Chief Executive Andy Jassy said earlier this
month the cuts, about 6% of the company's roughly 300,000
corporate employees, would mostly impact the e-commerce and
human resources divisions.Microsoft said earlier on Wednesday it would cut
about 10,000 jobs and take a $1.2-billion charge.
