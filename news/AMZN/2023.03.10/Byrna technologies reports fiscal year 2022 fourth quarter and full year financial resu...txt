For the full year of 2022, the Company saw increases in 'International Sales,' 'Dealer Sales,' and 'Amazon sales.' Specifically, International Sales increased by $5.7 million (or 164.6%), Dealer sales rose by $1.6 million (or 28.4%) and Amazon Sales grew by $4.6 million (or 522.5%). This more than offset the decline in Byrna.com sales of $6.6 million (or 20.9%) in FY22 as FY21 Byrna.com sales benefited from a one-time $9.0 million spike in sales attributable to an unsolicited endorsement from Sean Hannity in April 2021.Higher sales drove an increase in gross profit of $3.4 million to $26.3 million in FY22 as compared to gross profit of $22.9 million in FY21. The Gross margin percentage for the full year FY22 remained relatively consistent, at 54.7% compared to 54.3% in FY21, as the increase in the lower margin International and Dealer sales was offset by lower freight costs and an improved product mix.Operating expenses rose by $7.5 million to $33.7 million in FY22 from $26.2 million in FY21 due primarily to higher marketing expenditures, (up $3.3 million), non-cash stock compensation expense (up $2.3 million), and variable selling expenses (up $1.2 million). Variable selling expenses include such things as outbound freight, credit card and other transaction fees and sales-based fees and commissions.Net loss in FY22 was $(7.9) million, compared to a net loss of $(3.3) million in FY21. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA1, which excludes long-term non-cash stock-based compensation and one-time severance costs, was a loss of $(1.0) million versus a profit of $1.3 million in FY21.About Byrna Technologies Inc.Byrna is a technology company, specializing in the development, manufacture, and sale of innovative non-lethal personal security solutions.Forward Looking InformationThis news release contains 'forward-looking statements' within the meaning of the securities laws.
