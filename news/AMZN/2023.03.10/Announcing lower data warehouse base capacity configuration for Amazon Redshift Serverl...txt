Amazon Redshift now allows you to get started with Amazon Redshift Serverless with a lower data warehouse base capacity configuration of 8 Redshift Processing Units (RPU).Amazon Redshift Serverless measures data warehouse capacity in RPU and you pay only for the duration of workloads you run in RPU-hours on a per-second basis. Previously the minimum base capacity required to run serverless was 32 RPU. With the new lowered base capacity minimum of 8 RPU, you now have even more flexibility to support diverse set of workloads of small to large complexity based on your price performance requirements.Amazon Redshift Serverless allows you to run and scale analytics without having to provision and manage data warehouse clusters. With Amazon Redshift Serverless, all users including data analysts, developers, and data scientists, can use Amazon Redshift to get insights from data in seconds. With the new lower capacity configuration, you can use Amazon Redshift Serverless for production environments, test and development environments at an optimal price point when workload needs small amount of compute. You can increment or decrement the RPU in units of 8 RPU.The support for lower capacity configuration is now available for Amazon Redshift Serverless through the Amazon Redshift Console, API and CLI, and is available in the following AWS Regions: US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Paci?c (Singapore), Asia Paci?c (Sydney), Asia Paci?c (Tokyo), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland).To get started, see the Amazon Redshift Serverless feature page, user documentation, and API Reference.(C) 2023 Electronic News Publishing, source ENP Newswire
