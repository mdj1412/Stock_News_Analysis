QUITO, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Ecuador's state-run oil company
Petroecuador is supplying a key Amazon oil block with planes,
the firm said on Monday, as it seeks to overcome road blockades
erected by a local indigenous community.The block is one of two that Petroecuador took control of
in the country's Amazonian Orellana province from a subsidiary
of Canada's New Status Energy on Jan. 1.The pair of blocks, numbered 16 and 67, pump more than
14,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd).Ecuador is one of South America's smaller oil and gas
producers, behind Brazil, Colombia and Argentina.Amid the handover process, the Waorani community of Dikaro
in Orellana began closing access roads to block 16, demanding a
free and informed consultation process for the new operator of
the oil blocks.Petroecuador said in its statement that it had been flying
in "chemicals, oils and food to maintain the operation of block
16 and to supply personnel."Petroecuador did not specify whether the protest will impact
production in the areas, adding that road closures are due to
"demands that were not met by the private operator."The company said it had staff and contracting required to
continue operations, and would do so in compliance with labor
laws.CONFENIAE, the main organization of indigenous groups in
Ecuador's Amazon, wrote on Twitter that the Waorani community
has been in a "peaceful resistance" since Dec. 25 to defend its
territory and had asked the government to consult the community
concerning Petroecuador's operations, among other requests.The government has said that Petroecuador will temporarily
operate both blocks until an international tender is called to
designate a private operator.Petroecuador's production stood at about 396,000 bpd on
Sunday, according to official data.
