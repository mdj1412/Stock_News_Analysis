red on Thursday as fresh evidence of a tight labor market and
hawkish comments from policymakers deepened fears of elevated
interest rates for longer than expected.Thursday's ADP National Employment report showed a
higher-than-expected rise in private employment in December.
Another report showed weekly jobless claims fell last week.On Wednesday, another data set showed a moderate fall in
U.S. job openings, growing evidence the labor market remains
tight.Among the benchmark S&P 500's 11 major sectors, real estate
, which was the biggest percentage gainer on Wednesday,
was leading percentage losses down 2.6%, with utilities
next, falling 2.1%.While a strong labor market would often be welcomed as a
sign of economic strength investors currently see it as a key
reason for the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates high."It's very clear that good news on the labor market means
bad news for the stock market. Data is showing that the labor
market is very resilient," said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market
strategist at Ameriprise in Tory Michigan."As long as the labor market is resilient, the Federal
Reserve has to continue to tighten financial conditions to bring
inflation down," said that strategist who expects investors to
be keenly focused on wage inflation in Friday's jobs report.By 2:27PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell
302.88 points, or 0.91%, to 32,966.89, the S&P 500 lost
34.86 points, or 0.90%, to 3,818.11 and the Nasdaq Composite
dropped 112.01 points, or 1.07%, to 10,346.75.However, the indexes had pared losses a little on Thursday
after St. Louis Federal Reserve leader James Bullard in an
afternoon appearance that 2023 could finally bring some welcome
relief on the inflation front.While Saglimbene noted that Bullard's comments were not
surprising, his suggestion that rate hikes were starting to show
some signs of dampening inflation, provided some reassurance.In the previous session, Wall Street's main indexes erased
some of their gains after minutes from the Fed's December
meeting showed the central bank was laser-focused on fighting
inflation even as officials agreed to slow the pace of rate
hikes to limit risks to economic growth.Earlier in the day both Kansas City Fed leader Esther George
and Atlanta President Raphael Bostic stressed that the central
bank's priority was to curb inflation through policy tightening.Traders see rates peaking at slightly above 5% in June.The more comprehensive non farm payrolls report due on
Friday, will be looked to for further clues on labor demand and
the rate hike trajectory.Among individual stocks, Tesla Inc dropped 2.6%
after December sales of its China-made electric vehicles fell to
a five-month low, while Amazon.com Inc, which announced
increased layoff plans, was down 1.5%.Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc dropped 6.7% after the
drugstore chain posted a quarterly loss on an opioid litigation
charge.Home goods retailer Bed Bath & Beyond Inc was down
24% after saying it was exploring options, including bankruptcy.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a
1.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.41-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&P 500 posted 7 new 52-week highs and 7 new lows;
the Nasdaq Composite recorded 49 new highs and 61 new lows.
