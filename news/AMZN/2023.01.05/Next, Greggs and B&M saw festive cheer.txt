December footfall on high streets was 12.7% higher than in 2021, while shopping centres saw a 10.3% uplift and retail parks also enjoyed 3.6% more visitors. However, in the penultimate week before Christmas, marred by four days of rail strikes, footfall was 20.1% lower than 2019, more than doubling from 9.6% the week before.----------UK rail passengers face a third consecutive day of travel disruption on Thursday because of a strike by train drivers.

The guidance would represent growth of 4.5% against the year prior, if achieved. It said in the six months to December 30, full price sales were up 2.2% against the previous year. In the three months to December 30, full price sales were up 4.7% against the year prior. In the nine weeks to December 30 alone, they were up 4.8% annually. "Sales in the Christmas period have been better than we anticipated," the company explained. Next, nonetheless, said it remained "cautious" in its outlook for the year ahead, with initial guidance for the year ending January 2024 at GBP795 million for pretax profit. It also expects a full price sales decline of 1.5% in that year against the current year. During financial 2023, Next has tinkered with its guidance on several occasions. It initially forecast pretax profit of GBP860 million, but then lowered this to GBP850 million in March. It raised its outlook back to GBP860 million in August, but cut it to GBP840 million in September. ----------Retailer B&M European Value Retail reported strong momentum across its "golden" third quarter despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. In the 13-week period from September 25, revenue grew by 12% year-on-year to GBP1.57 billion. It noted a very good performance across all B&M UK categories, both in grocery and general merchandise, as well as solid momentum in B&M France and Heron Foods. As a result, full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation are now expected between GBP560 million to GBP580 million, coming above current analyst outlook consensus of GBP557 million. ----------COMPANIES - FTSE 250----------Bakery chain Greggs noted strong double-digit growth in fourth quarter sales, despite the impact of adverse weather and strikes at the end of 2022. Like-for-like sales in company-managed shops grew by 18% as a result of a favourable trading pattern leading into the Christmas period and softer trading conditions in the comparable quarter of 2021 due to disruption caused by the Omicron variant of Covid. In 2022, sales totalled GBP1.51 billion, up 23% from GBP1.23 billion the previous year. Greggs said it expects its full-year results to be in line with previous expectations. "While market conditions in 2023 will remain challenging, our value-for-money offer of freshly-prepared food and drink is highly relevant as consumers look to manage their budgets without compromising on quality and taste," the chain said.----------OTHER COMPANIES----------Mattioli Woods reported a "resilient" trading performance in the six months ended November 30, despite a "complex" macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop.

Mattioli Woods said its outlook for the full-year remains in line with expectations.

The housebuilder posted revenue of EUR649 million, up 36% against the previous year. Operating profit improved to around EUR70 million from EUR50.6 million, while its gross margin fell to 17% from 17.4%. Glenveagh said it was also beginning a buyback programme to repurchase up to 10% of the firm's share capital." Looking forward, the firm said it was "very well positioned" to grow longer term revenue and profitability. It currently expects an earnings per share outturn for 2023 in line with its 2022 performance. ----------Amazon announced Wednesday it will cut more than 18,000 jobs from its workforce, citing "the uncertain economy" and the fact that the online retail giant had "hired rapidly" during the pandemic.

The company had announced 10,000 layoffs in November.
