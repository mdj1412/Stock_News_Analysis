March 8 (Reuters) - A 3D-printed rocket built by
California-based startup Relativity Space was due for blastoff
in Florida on its first mission to orbit on Wednesday in a key
test of the company's novel strategy for cutting manufacturing
costs.The 110-foot-tall (35-meter) Terran 1 rocket, 85% of which
was fabricated from a 3D-printer, was set to lift off from a
U.S. Space Force Base launch pad in Cape Canaveral."The launch that we're preparing for is an opportunity to
demonstrate a whole bunch of things all at once," said Josh
Brost, Relativity's senior vice president of revenue.Brost called the Terran 1 "by far the largest 3D-printed
structure that's ever been assembled."Relativity had planned to launch the rocket at 1 p.m. EST
(1800 GMT), but company commentators in a live-streamed
broadcast said a new liftoff time was set for 2 p.m. (1900 GMT)
The rocket has a window of launch opportunity lasting until 4
p.m. (2100 GMT)The 3D-printing process, widely used in various industries,
involves machines that autonomously "print" sequential layers of
soft, liquid or powdered materials that are quickly hardened or
fused to form solid, three-dimensional objects. Designs of the
objects are scanned from digital blueprints.Relativity, one of a handful of U.S. rocket startups
competing to meet the growing demand for cheap launch services,
has bet on the cost savings it expects to achieve using giant,
robotic 3D-printers to simplify its rocket production lines.
Most of its rivals have focused on lowering costs by building
rockets designed to be reuseable, such as the Falcon 9 boosters
produced by Elon Musk's SpaceX.The use of 3D-printers, Brost said, allows Relativity to
hasten much of its manufacturing processes and more easily make
changes to improve the rocket's design if needed after it flies,
eliminating the need for a complex supply chain that would
otherwise slow down rocket enhancements.While the expendable Terran 1 is built to carry 2,755 pounds
(1,250 kg) of satellites to low-Earth orbit, waning demand for
that class of launch vehicle has led Relativity to develop a
larger, 3D-printed reusable rocket - the Terran R - that it
expects to fly in 2024.Currently driving demand are the so-called
mega-constellation plans by companies such as SpaceX, OneWeb and
Jeff Bezos' Amazon to deploy tens of thousands of
internet-beaming satellites to low-Earth orbit in the next few
years.SpaceX flies its own heavy-lift rockets to get its Starlink
network into orbit, while Amazon and OneWeb plan to use similar
large rockets from various launch companies for their own
satellites. OneWeb will launch its next-generation satellites on
Relativity's Terran R, the companies announced last year.Relativity, headquartered in Long Beach, California, has
roughly $1.65 billion worth of launch contracts secured for both
its rockets, with the bulk of that revenue attributable to the
larger Terran R.While market demand for rockets like Terran 1 has weakened,
Brost said the rocket's upcoming flights will inform how Terran
R is engineered.Asked if Relativity is still selling Terran 1 to customers,
Brost said the company "continues to talk to people about both
vehicles."(Reporting by Joey Roulette in Washington; Editing by Steve
