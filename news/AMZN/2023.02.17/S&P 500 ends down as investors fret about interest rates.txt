and Nvidia as investors worried that inflation and a strong U.S.
economy could put the Federal Reserve on pace for more interest
rate hikes.The see-saw session on Wall Street followed economic data
this week that pointed to elevated inflation, a tight job market
and resilience in consumer spending, giving the Fed more room
for to raise borrowing costs.Goldman Sachs and Bank of America forecast three more rate
hikes this year and by a quarter of a percentage point each, up
from their previous estimate of two rate rises.Traders are expecting at least two more rate increases and
see the Fed rate peaking at 5.3% by July as central bank
attempts to cool the economy and reduce inflation."A dark cloud has drifted over the stock market in the last
two weeks based on a higher watermark for the Fed funds rate,"
said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset
Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma."The jobs numbers aren't getting weaker, and it's hard to go
into a recession with a strong labor market at the same time.
That means the Fed could push the button and move rates higher,"
Dollarhide said.Microsoft Corp, Nvidia and Amazon.com Inc
lost ground and weighed heavily on the S&P 500 as the
yield on 10-year Treasury notes hit a three-month
high.The CBOE Volatility index, also known as Wall
Street's fear gauge, traded above 20 points for a second session
in a row.According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 lost 10.99
points, or 0.27%, to end at 4,079.42 points, while the Nasdaq
Composite lost 68.56 points, or 0.58%, to 11,786.34. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 133.73 points, or
0.40%, to 33,828.44.The S&P 500 has gained about 6% so far in 2023, while the
Nasdaq has rebounded about 13% following deep losses last year.Adding to recent worries about monetary policy, Fed Governor
Michelle Bowman said the central bank will need to keep raising
interest rates until it makes much more progress tackling
inflation. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said the central
bank still needs to raise interest rates, but that it could
stick with quarter-point increases.Moderna Inc fell after its experimental messenger
RNA-based influenza vaccine delivered mixed results in a study.Deere & Co surged after the world's largest farm
equipment maker raised its annual profit and beat quarterly
earnings expectations.Lithium miners Livent Corp, Albemarle Corp
