WASHINGTON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade
Commission will not file a complaint aimed at stopping
Amazon.com's plan to buy primary care provider One
Medical, an FTC official said on Tuesday.Amazon.com Inc said in July it would buy One Medical for
$3.49 billion, expanding the e-commerce giant's virtual
healthcare business and adding brick-and-mortar doctors' offices
for the first time.Amazon declined comment about the FTC decision.The FTC official said that the agency planned to send a
pre-consummation warning letter that would say it still had
specific concerns about the deal. Antitrust agencies can, and
sometimes do, file complaints to undo mergers that have closed.The official said the agency would watch for any potential
harm to competition as well as how consumer data was used.The deal is part of Amazon's long-running ambition to delve
deeper into healthcare, helping consumers receive more efficient
medical advice and medicines. The company has yet to disrupt the
complex industry as it has book and other retail sales.The online retailer first piloted virtual care visits
for its own staff in Seattle in 2019 before offering services to
other employers under the Amazon Care brand, which it has since
said that it would wind down.Amazon likewise bought online pharmacy PillPack in 2018,
underpinning a prescription delivery and price-comparison site
it later launched.One Medical is in more than a dozen U.S. markets and gives
members access to virtual care at any time of the day or night.
It provides services to the employees of some 8,500 companies.The FTC is also probing Amazon.com's plan to buy Roomba
maker iRobot Corp for $1.7 billion. Senator Elizabeth
Warren has urged that the deal be stopped.Separate from the merger probes, the FTC has been
investigating Amazon.com since mid-2019 amid allegations that
the company abuses its dominance of online retail.That probe was part of a series of investigations into Big
Tech begun by the FTC and Justice Department during the Trump
administration. They have resulted in two lawsuits against
Alphabet's Google and one against Meta's Facebook.
