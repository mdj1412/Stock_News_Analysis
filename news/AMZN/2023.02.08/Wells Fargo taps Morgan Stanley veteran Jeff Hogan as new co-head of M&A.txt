NEW YORK, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co on
Wednesday named a top Morgan Stanley banker as its new global
co-head of mergers and acquisitions, as part of the bank's
efforts to ramp up its investment banking franchise under Chief
Executive Charles Scharf.Jeff Hogan, who spent over 25 years at Morgan Stanley, will
join Wells Fargo later this year and will be based out of New
York. He will lead Wells Fargo's dealmaking unit alongside David
DeNunzio, the current global head of M&A at the bank.Hogan, who most recently served as co-head of global
technology M&A at Morgan Stanley, has spent most of his career
putting together deals primarily in the technology, media and
telecom (TMT) industries.Notable deals that Hogan advised on include Canadian telecom
giant BCE’s $61.7 billion spin-off of Nortel Networks, Suncor
Energy’s $18.2 merger with PetroCanada and MGM’s $8.45 billion
sale to Amazon.com Inc."As co-heads of global M&A, David and Jeff will partner
closely with the broader M&A team around strategy, client
targeting, and content to further grow our franchise," a Wells
Fargo spokeswoman said.Hogan's hire comes at a time when Wells Fargo is attempting
to bulk up its dealmaking franchise under Scharf and win market
share from larger investment banking rivals like Goldman Sachs
Group and JPMorgan Chase.Last year, Wells Fargo broke into the top-10 rankings for
M&A advisers for the first time in its history, after advising
on several high-profile transactions including Broadcom Inc's
$61 billion planned takeover of VMWare Inc, Kroger Co's pending
combination with Albertsons, and Intercontinental Exchange Inc's
proposed acquisition of Black Knight Inc.
