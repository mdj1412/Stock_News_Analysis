LOS ANGELES, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The No. 1 U.S. seaport
had its second-busiest year in 2022, even after ongoing West
Coast port labor talks, cooling demand for consumer goods and
global recession fears reduced cargo volume in the second half
of the year.The Port of Los Angeles handled 9.9 million twenty-foot
equivalent units (TEU) last year. That was down 7.2% from 2021,
when the 115-year-old seaport set an all-time cargo record, port
officials said.The Port of Los Angeles and the adjacent Port of Long Beach
typically handle about half of U.S. container shipments. The
complex lost market share to rival ports on the Atlantic and
Gulf Coasts in 2022 after shippers rerouted goods to avoid
potential disruptions from contract talks between union
dockworkers and their employers.Shipments for major retailers like Walmart, Home
Depot, Target and Amazon.com dominated
the U.S. container transportation business, accounting for about
half of total volume.The industry's imports also are shaping up to finish at near
record levels in 2022. https://tmsnrt.rs/3WavFPqThat comes despite a sharp drop in the latter half of 2022,
when the United States and other countries lifted COVID-19
infection control measures and consumers resumed spending on
previously restricted dining, travel and other entertainment.
That change in buying behavior swamped stores and warehouses
with unsold kitchen gadgets, big-screen televisions, apparel and
other goods.The Port of Los Angeles in December added to its string of
monthly import declines with an 8.6% year-over-year drop.Forecasters expect U.S. import weakness to persist in 2023,
but some are starting to predict when the business could
rebound.Trucking company JB Hunt on Wednesday said its
customers could be finished clearing unsold inventory some time
in the second quarter of 2023, which could set the stage for
import reorders in the second half of the year.(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Josie
