OluKai, an Hawaiian-inspired footwear company, is deploying Jitterbit technology to streamline sales and fulfillment processes and improve team productivity.The technology connected the retailer's enterprise resource planning system with Amazon to boost the recording of sales, return and inventory movement, according to a press release.When OluKai began selling on Amazon, the move made it difficult and time-consuming to log sales data from the Amazon Seller Central platform into the company's ERP and led to diminished productivity among team members, data inaccuracies and complications with fulfillment.OluKai was a customer of eBridge Connections, an e-commerce integration provider acquired by Jitterbit in 2021, prior to the technology effort.So far the retailer's return on investment include more accurate and automated tracking of sales, returns and general inventory movement."Our capacity at Amazon grew fast and the day-to-day work that was needed to keep up created a real challenge," Jason Ekinaka, operations manager at Olukai, said in the release. "Using Jitterbit, we went from weekly or bimonthly inventory updates to daily updates, which has been a game-changer. The improved accuracy gives us a better feel for our inventory, and our internal systems can more accurately record how Amazon is performing."Copyright Â© 2023 Networld Media.
