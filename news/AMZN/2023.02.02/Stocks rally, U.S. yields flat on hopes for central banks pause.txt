*Markets see Fed, BoE and ECB rate hike cycle end on
horizon*Dollar bounces after biggest daily pct drop in a monthNEW YORK, Feb 2 (Reuters) - A gauge of global stocks
climbed for a third straight day and longer-dated U.S. Treasury
yields were flat on Thursday, as policy announcements from a
host of central banks added to optimism that the cycles of
interest rate hike cycles may be near an end.After the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates by 25 basis
points (bps) on Wednesday, as was widely expected, markets
rallied following comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell
acknowledging the "disinflationary" process may have begun.The European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of England (BoE)
hiked by 50 basis points each on Thursday, with the BoE
signaling the tide was turning against inflation and the ECB
indicating at least one more hike was on the horizon.On Wall Street, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rallied, with the S&P
500 touching its highest intraday level since Aug. 26 and the
Nasdaq hitting its highest since Sept. 12, getting an additional
boost from a 27.06% surge in Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc
following its quarterly results and $40 billion buyback
announcement."The market has a different outlook. Judging from past
forecasts, the Fed is pretty awful. Also, the Fed knows the
economy is slowing but Fed Chairs never come out and say these
things," Steven Blitz, Chief U.S. Economist at TS Lombard told
the Reuters Global Markets Forum."So the market sees through this, and after being fooled in
2021 into believing no hikes into 2024 and they are not as
readily willing to be fooled into believing no cuts until 2024."The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 37.98 points,
or 0.11%, to 34,054.98 while the S&P 500 gained 68.63
points, or 1.67%, to 4,187.84 and the Nasdaq Composite
added 426.53 points, or 3.61%, to 12,242.85.On the economic front, weekly initial jobless claims dropped
to a nine-month low, showing the labor market remains strong,
while worker productivity in the fourth quarter accelerated.
Investors will eye the January payrolls report on Friday for
further signs of labor market strength.After the closing bell, earnings from heavyweights Apple Inc
and Amazon.com Inc are scheduled to be
released. With 46% of the S&P 500 having reported results,
earnings for the quarter are expected to decline from the
year-ago period, according to Refinitiv data, compared with a
1.6% expected decline at the start of the year.European stocks also jumped, with the STOXX 600 closing at
its highest level since April 21 as it notched its biggest
one-day percentage gain in a month.The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.35% and
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained
1.31%. The MSCI index hit its highest intraday level since May 5
and was on track for its ninth gain in the past ten sessions.Benchmark 10-year notes were unchanged to 3.398%
after yields earlier had moved lower.The dollar bounced, however, from its biggest one-day
percentage drop in nearly a month on Wednesday, while the euro
also weakened following the ECB announcement.The dollar index rose 0.674%, with the euro
down 0.64% to $1.0919.The Japanese yen strengthened 0.34% versus the
greenback at 128.51 per dollar, while sterling was last
trading at $1.2249, down 1.03% on the day.In commodities, oil prices were slightly higher, with U.S.
crude recently rose 0.37% to $76.69 per barrel and Brent
at $82.99, up 0.18% on the day.(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; additional reporting by Karen
