*Markets see Fed, BoE and ECB rate hike cycle end on
horizon*Dollar bounces after biggest daily pct drop in a monthNEW YORK, Feb 2 (Reuters) - A gauge of global stocks
rallied and U.S. Treasury yields mostly fell on Thursday, as
policy announcements from a string of central banks fueled
optimism that interest rate hike cycles may be nearing an end.After the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates by 25 basis
points (bps), as was widely expected, on Wednesday, markets
rallied following comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell
acknowledging the "disinflationary" process may have begun.The European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of England (BoE)
hiked by 50 basis points each on Thursday, with the BoE
signaling the tide was turning against inflation and the ECB
indicating at least one more hike was on the horizon.On Wall Street, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq climbed, with the S&P
500 touching its highest intraday level since Aug. 26 and the
Nasdaq hitting its highest since Sept. 12, getting an additional
boost from a 24.24% surge in Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc
following its quarterly results and $40 billion buyback
announcment."Central banks are in data-dependant mode, but that means
that they’re no longer in control and so markets are basically
leading the central banks at the moment," said Mazen Issa,
senior FX strategist at TD Securities in New York."It sounds like they may be nearing a pause. That doesn’t
necessarily mean that they’ll be cutting rates immediately, but
it means that its going to be much more difficult to price in
higher rates from here, at least for now."The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 93.99 points,
or 0.28%, to 33,998.97; the S&P 500 gained 59.88 points,
or 1.45%, to 4,179.09; and the Nasdaq Composite added

while worker productivity in the fourth quarter accelerated.
