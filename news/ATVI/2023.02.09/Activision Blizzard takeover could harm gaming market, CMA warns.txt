MICROSOFT's proposed acquisition of gaming firm Activision Blizzard could result in higher prices, fewer choices or less innovation for UK gamers, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has said.In the provisional findings of its five-month investigation into the $68.7bn (Â£56.7bn) deal, the CMA said the merger could make Microsoft stronger, stifle competition and harm the rivalry between its Xbox console and Sony's Playstation.Activision Blizzard is the maker of a number of popular video games series, including Call Of Duty, and rivals have raised concerns that Microsoft taking over Activision could see their access to the popular franchise restricted - somethingMicrosoft has denied.In response, Microsoft's corporate vice president and deputy general counsel, Rima Alaily, said: "We are committed to offering effective and easily enforceable solutions that address the CMA's concerns. "Seventy-five per cent of respondents to the CMA's public consultation agree that this deal is good for competition in UK gaming."PA(c) 2023 City A.M., source Newspaper
