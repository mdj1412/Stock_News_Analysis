HONG KONG, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Chinese games publisher
NetEase Inc NTES.O said on Wednesday it has rejected a
proposal from Activision Blizzard Inc to extend their
long-time partnership for six months, as the U.S. game developer
looks for a new partner.NetEase said the proposal was "commercially illogical" and
accused the U.S. firm of "seeking a divorce but still remaining
attached," in a rare public display of acrimony between the two
gaming giants.Blizzard said in November it would end its 14-year
partnership with NetEase - sending shockwaves across the
industry as the partnership was widely seen as one of the most
lucrative in video games.The companies had been unable to agree on key terms of
cooperation and hits such as 'World of Warcraft' will not be
available in China, the world’s largest gaming market, from Jan.
23.NetEase said Blizzard reached out last week with an offer to
extend the partnership for six months but also made it clear
that it would not stop negotiating with other potential
partners."Considering the non-reciprocity, unfairness and other
strict conditions attached to the cooperation, the parties could
not reach an agreement in the end," China's second-largest
gaming company said in a statement.The exact sticking points that soured the deal, which
started in 2008 and was renewed in 2019, remain unclear.A person close to Blizzard said the dispute that scuttled
the renewal revolved around commercial terms rather than data
issues as some media had reported.The person, who declined to be identified due to the
sensitivity of the issue, said NetEase had proposed to make
structural changes to the partnership that would affect
Blizzard’s control over its intellectual property (IP).In its statement late on Tuesday, NetEase said it had
never requested control over IP from Blizzard or any other
partners as a publishing company over the past 14 years.“Any usage and licensing of Blizzard’s IP were done in
accordance with contract terms and with Blizzard’s consent and
approval,” it said.Activision Blizzard did not immediately respond to a Reuters
request for comment.With the demise of their partnership, Blizzard is currently
without a Chinese publisher. Unlike other countries, foreign
gaming companies typically need a Chinese publisher before they
can release games in China.NetEase rose to become a gaming giant partly by publishing
Blizzard's games in China. It has since accelerated its own game
development capability, with in-house games now accounting for
more than 60% of revenue.
