The company defines organic FX-Neutral revenue growth as reported revenue growth, excluding incremental revenue from acquisitions or dispositions for the twelve-month period following such acquisitions or dispositions and foreign exchange rate effects.These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses, or net purchases of property and equipment, as the case may be, that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because the company has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting.For its internal budgeting process, and as discussed further below, the company's management uses financial measures that do not include stock-based compensation expense, employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation, amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, amortization of deferred tax assets associated with the realignment of its legal structure and related foreign exchange effects, significant gains or losses from the disposal/acquisition of a business, certain gains and losses on investments including changes in fair value, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of any related foreign exchange derivative instruments, gains or losses associated with a warrant agreement that the company entered into with Adyen, restructuring-related charges and the income taxes associated with the foregoing. In addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, the company's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing the financial results of the company.The company excludes the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP effective tax rate:Stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes. This expense consists of expenses for stock options, restricted stock and employee stock purchases. The company excludes stock-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that management does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. The related employer payroll taxes are dependent on the company's stock price and the vesting of restricted stock by employees and the timing and size of stock option exercises, over which management has limited to no control, and as such management does not believe it correlates to the company's operation of the business.Amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, certain amortization of deferred tax assets and related foreign exchange effects, significant gains or losses and transaction expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and certain gains or losses on investments. The company incurs amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions and may incur significant gains or losses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and therefore excludes these amounts from its non-GAAP measures. The company also excludes certain gains and losses on investments. The company excludes the non-cash amortization of deferred tax assets associated with the realignment of its legal structure, which is not reduced by the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and related foreign exchange effects. The company excludes these items because management does not believe they correlate to the ongoing operating results of the company's business.Restructuring. These charges consist of expenses for employee severance and other exit and disposal costs. The company excludes significant restructuring charges primarily because management does not believe they are reflective of ongoing operating results.Other certain significant gains, losses, or charges that are not indicative of the company's core operating results. These are significant gains, losses, or charges during a period that are the result of isolated events or transactions which have not occurred frequently in the past and are not expected to occur regularly or be repeated in the future. The company excludes these amounts from its results primarily because management does not believe they are indicative of its current or ongoing operating results. These amounts include changes in fair value and the related change in foreign currency exchange rates of equity securities with readily determinable fair values, globally.Change in fair market value of warrant. These are gains or losses associated with a warrant agreement that the company entered into with Adyen, which are attributable to changes in fair value during the period.Income tax effects and adjustments. We use a non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating our operating results. Based on our current long-term projections, we are using a non-GAAP tax rate of 16.5%. This non-GAAP tax rate could change for various reasons including significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate.In addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, the company also uses free cash flow. Free cash flow represents operating cash flows less purchases of property and equipment. The company considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property, buildings, and equipment, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in the company's business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase stock and pay dividends. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the company's cash balance for the period.eBay Inc.Reconciliation of GAAP Operating Income to Non-GAAP Operating Income*Three Months EndedDecember 31,Year EndedDecember 31,2022202120222021(In millions, except percentages)GAAP operating income$ 565$ 688$ 2,350$ 2,923Stock-based compensation expense and related employerpayroll taxes130115507489Amortization of acquired intangible assets within cost of netrevenues and operating expenses5-99Other significant gains, losses or charges50237358Total non-GAAP operating income adjustments185138589556Non-GAAP operating income$ 750$ 826$ 2,939$ 3,479Non-GAAP operating margin29.9 %31.6 %30.0 %33.4 %*Presented on a continuing operations basisReconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP Net Income andGAAP Effective Tax Rate to Non-GAAP Effective Tax RateThree Months EndedDecember 31,Year EndedDecember 31,2022202120222021(In millions, except per share amounts and percentages)GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations before incometaxes$ 829$ (1,161)$ (1,601)$ 398GAAP (provision) benefit for income taxes(158)268327(146)GAAP net income (loss) from continuing operations$ 671$ (893)$ (1,274)$ 252Non-GAAP adjustments to net income (loss) from continuingoperations:Non-GAAP operating income from continuing operationsadjustments (see table above)$ 185$ 138$ 589$ 556Loss on investments(20)275861(361)Change in fair market value of warrant(16)29230(354)Change in fair value of equity investment in Adevinta(282)1,5732,6913,070Other significant gains, losses or charges-(71)(1)(85)Income tax effects and adjustments43(404)(784)(417)Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations$ 581$ 647$ 2,312$ 2,661Diluted net income (loss) from continuing operations per share:GAAP$ 1.23$ (1.47)$ (2.28)$ 0.38Non-GAAP$ 1.07$ 1.05$ 4.11$ 4.02Shares used in GAAP diluted net income (loss) per-sharecalculation544606558663Shares used in non-GAAP diluted net income per-sharecalculation544615562663GAAP effective tax rate - Continuing operations19.1 %23.1 %20.4 %36.6 %Income tax effects and adjustments to net income (loss) fromcontinuing operations(2.6) %(5.8) %(3.9) %(19.2) %Non-GAAP effective tax rate - Continuing operations16.5 %17.3 %16.5 %17.4 %Reconciliation of Operating Cash Flow to Free Cash FlowThree Months EndedDecember 31,Year EndedDecember 31,2022202120222021(In millions)Net cash provided by continuing operating activities$ 686$ 475$ 2,627$ 3,093Less: Purchases of property and equipment(153)(103)(449)(444)Free cash flow$ 533$ 372$ 2,178$ 2,649eBay Inc.Investor Relations Contact:John Egbertir@ebay.comMedia Relations Contact:Trina Somerapress@ebay.comCompany News:https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/Investor Relations website:https://investors.ebayinc.com.(C) 2023 M2 COMMUNICATIONS, source M2 PressWIRE
