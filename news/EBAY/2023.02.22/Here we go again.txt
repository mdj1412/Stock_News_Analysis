The return to work after the long weekend was a bit brutal yesterday on Wall Street, with a drop of 2% for the S&P500, -2.06% for the Dow Jones and -2.4% for the Nasdaq 100. Only the most defensive segments of the market held up. In finance, the companies perceived as the most defensive are those that will continue to sell commodities when consumers have cut the superfluous. Specifically, yesterday, food, gas and beer sellers. Add to this weapon manufacturers, after the further deterioration of relations between the West and Russia, after Vladimir Putin's decision to suspend a nuclear weapon control treaty.

The lack of appetite for risk assets prolongs a phase of doubt that has been building over the past week. The powerful rebound following the annus horribilis 2022 was based on two pillars: the recovery of the Chinese economy and the proximity of the end of the Fed's rate hike cycle. At the moment, the Chinese reopening has not delivered its promises, while the Fed's supposed victory over inflation doesn't look so clear anymore. This victory was personalized by the decline in price increases and several macroeconomic indicators showing that the economic overheating was cooling. The problem is that these indicators have tended to stabilize, or even accelerate for some in recent days. As a result, the big bet that investors would return to a looser monetary policy is now fading. Yesterday, the US PMI indicators were quite clearly above expectations, a further signal of caution for the market, on the grounds that good news for the economy is not necessarily good news for finance, which prefers low rates to any other scenario.
The yield on US 10-year debt jumped to 3.94% yesterday, whereas it was 50 points lower not so long ago. This means that the market expects the Fed Funds rate to rise to more than 5.3% this summer, whereas the expectation was still 4.9% at the beginning of February. Investors now believe the Fed will raise rates beyond what they feared and the debate is still open about how long the rates will stay high. That's not good news for stocks. Nor for bonds, some of which have lost almost all of their 2023 gains (bond prices move inversely to their yield).
Today, earnings releases continue with some big names like Nvidia, Pioneer Natural Resources and eBay. Investors are trading cautiously this morning ahead the publication of the minutes of the last Fed meeting (3:00 pm), and Wall Street's three main indices are flat. In other news, the yield on Japanese public debt has settled for the second day above the theoretical ceiling set by the Bank of Japan. Washington is threatening to sanction Chinese companies that support Russia's invasion of Ukraine and oil is contracting in a market that doubts the global economic momentum ahead.
