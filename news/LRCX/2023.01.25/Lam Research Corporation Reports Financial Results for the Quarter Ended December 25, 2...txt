"Lam closed out 2022 with record revenue and earnings per share for both the December quarter and calendar year, despite supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures," said Tim Archer, Lam Research's President and Chief Executive Officer. "Given the decline in wafer fabrication equipment spending expected in calendar year 2023, we are taking proactive steps to lower our cost structure and drive efficiencies across our global footprint, while preserving critical R&D. With these actions, Lam is focused on accelerating our strategic priorities to capitalize on the semiconductor industry's long-term growth prospects."
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Results
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances increased to $4.8 billion at the end of the December 2022 quarter compared to $4.6 billion at the end of the September 2022 quarter. This increase was primarily the result of $1,140 million of cash generated from operating activities, partially offset by $456 million of share repurchases, including net share settlement of employee stock-based compensation; $236 million of dividends paid to stockholders; and $163 million of capital expenditures.
Deferred revenue at the end of the December 2022 quarter decreased to $1,984 million compared to $2,755 million as of the end of the September 2022 quarter. Lam's deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to customers in Japan, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to customers in Japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The estimated future revenue from shipments to customers in Japan was approximately $379 million as of December 25, 2022 and $401 million as of September 25, 2022.

The information provided above is only an estimate of what the Company believes is realizable as of the date of this release and does not incorporate the potential impact of any business combinations, asset acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring, balance sheet valuation adjustments, financing arrangements, other investments, or other significant arrangements that may be completed or recognized after the date of this release, except as described below. U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items provided include only those items that are known and can be estimated as of the date of this release. Actual results will vary from this model and the variations may be material. Reconciling items included above are as follows:
Gross margin as a percentage of revenue - amortization related to intangible assets acquired through business combinations, $3 million; and restructuring charges, $42 million; totaling $45 million.Operating income as a percentage of revenue - amortization related to intangible assets acquired through business combinations, $4 million; and restructuring charges, $80 million; totaling $84 million.Net income per diluted share - amortization related to intangible assets acquired though business combinations, $4 million; restructuring charges; $80 million; amortization of note discounts, $1 million; and associated tax benefit for non-GAAP items ($11 million); totaling $74 million.Use of Non-GAAP Financial Results
In addition to U.S. GAAP results, this press release also contains non-GAAP financial results. The Company's non-GAAP results for both the December 2022 and September 2022 quarters exclude amortization related to intangible assets acquired through business combinations, the effects of elective deferred compensation-related assets and liabilities, amortization of note discounts, and the net income tax effect of non-GAAP items. Additionally, the non-GAAP results for the December 2022 quarter excludes a net income tax benefit associated with legal entity restructuring.
Management uses non-GAAP gross margin, operating expense, operating income, operating income as a percentage of revenue, net income, and net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. Tables presenting reconciliations of non-GAAP results to U.S. GAAP results are included at the end of this press release and on the Company's website at https://investor.lamresearch.com.
