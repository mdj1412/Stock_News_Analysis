But we start this morning with an anniversary, that of American presidents. January 20th is indeed the day when the presidents of the United States of America start their term of office, according to the XXth amendment of the American constitution, dating from 1937. Based on this measure, Joe Biden's term has two years left, with some worries about the debt ceiling. To put it simply, the US debt is large and constantly growing, the maximum amount of which has been set for more than a century by Congress. As a result, Congressmen have to vote regularly to raise it. This is not really a concern when the houses are controlled by the party that occupies the White House, but it becomes a concern in the event of power sharing, as is currently the case. Raising the ceiling is then the subject of intense negotiations, since it is a powerful political lever: if the United States can no longer borrow, it can no longer honor some of its obligations. In the past, there have been some memorable standoffs. They have been a source of volatility on markets, even though they have always led to compromise...

This comes after the publication of statistics on Wednesday that have raised fears of a harder-than-expected economic landing. The Nasdaq lost 1% after having already given up 1.3% the day before and the S&P500 fell -0.8%, for a third session in the red. The US broad index, at the doorstep of 3900 points, is now down only 1.5% in 2023. For your information, the average of the expectations of 23 big names in finance is 4079 points for the S&P500 next December 31 (according to forecasts compiled by François Trahan). That's 4.6% of potential growth from the 3900 points touched last night. Projections range from 3,400 points for those big pessimists at BNP, to 4,750 points for the unicorns and rainbows at Fundstrat. However, there is little point in fiddling with strategies based on these, since the stars of the market are just as complacent as the average equity fan. In other words, this kind of forecasting doesn't work very well, except when markets are only going up. At the end of 2021, Goldman Sachs was telling its clients that the S&P500 would hit 5100 points by the end of 2022. JPMorgan Chase, in a prudent move, was content with 5050 points. As a result, instead of the 6 to 7% increase predicted by these two major Wall Street institutions, the S&P500 fell 19.4% last year.
What else happened in the world yesterday? Central bankers continued to make tough speeches about monetary policy, trying to convince investors who do not believe them that they have not changed course. This was the case with Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard. As for Japan, it recorded inflation in December at 4%, the highest level since 1981. A level in line with expectations but which continues to question the BoJ's ultra-accommodating policy. Faced with these cautious signals, investors are focusing on the return of growth in China. This has allowed oil to move forward again and Hong Kong to wake up for the last session of the week. They will have time to meditate on the Chinese dynamics in a calm environment, since the country's markets will be closed for the Lunar New Year from Monday. Hong Kong will be closed on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, while Shanghai and Shenzhen will be closed all next week.
