        CCRSI RELEASE - January 2022
        (With data through December 2022)
      

        This month's CoStar Commercial Repeat Sale Indices (CCRSI) provides the market's first look at commercial real estate pricing trends through December 2022. Based on 1,495 sale pairs in December 2022 and more than 285,200 repeat sales since 1996, the CCRSI offers the broadest measure of commercial real estate repeat sales activity.
      

        CCRSI National Results Highlights
      



            U.S. COMPOSITE PRICE INDICES DIVERGED IN DECEMBER 2022 AS ANNUAL GAINS CONTINUED TO SLOW. The value-weighted U.S. Composite Index, which is more heavily influenced by high-value trades common in core markets, edged one point higher to 291 in December 2022, a gain of 0.2%, after falling for the prior four consecutive months, revised data show. The index was down by 1.6% in the 12-month period that ended in December 2022 but is 27.3% higher than in February 2020, before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
          



            Meanwhile, the equal-weighted U.S. composite index, which reflects the more numerous but lower-priced property sales typical of secondary and tertiary markets, fell three points to 310 in December 2022, a fall of 0.7% over the prior month, its second consecutive monthly loss, revised data show. The index gained 5.2% in the 12-month period that ended in December 2022 and is 30.7% above its February 2020 pre-pandemic level.
          



            Both composite indices have been on a broad decelerating trend in year-over-year growth for the last six consecutive months as markets respond to an environment of higher interest rates as the Federal Reserve battles decades-high inflation.
          






            BOTH MARKET SEGMENTS OF THE EQUAL-WEIGHTED COMPOSITE PRICE INDEX FELL IN DECEMBER 2022, the second [consecutive?] month of declines.
          



            The investment grade sub-index, more heavily influenced by higher-value assets, fell by 1.4% in December 2022, following a 1.7% decline in the prior month. The index saw growth of 1.6% over the 12-month period that ended in December 2022, its smallest 12-month gain since June 2020.
          



            The general commercial sub-index, more heavily influenced by smaller, lower-priced assets, fell by 0.1% in December 2022, following a 0.7% decline in the prior month. This sub-index gained 6.8% over the 12-month period that ended in December 2022, its smallest 12-month gain since March 2021, revised data show.
          






            THE MULTIFAMILY SECTOR DROVE MOST OF THE PRICE GAINS IN THE VALUE-WEIGHTED INDEX OVER THE PAST DECADE. However, that sub-index has fallen in the past five consecutive months.
          



            Although accounting for about 26% of the repeat trades recorded in December 2022, multifamily trades comprised 46.6% of the total monthly composite transaction volume.
          



            The multifamily sector sub-index fell by 1.4% in December 2022, its fifth month of decline since reaching a peak of 421 in June and July 2022. The index saw price growth of 1% in the 12-month period that ended in December 2022, its slowest year-over-year gain since June 2010, when the index recorded an annual decline. Net absorption in multifamily units reached historic highs in 2021 in response to pandemic-era impacts on the housing market, motivating double-digit annual price gains and making the sector an attractive asset class. However, with both prices and mortgage rates elevated, eroding affordability has tempered absorption more recently.
          



            The value-weighted composite index excluding the multifamily sector rose by 1.5% in December 2022 after edging lower in the prior two months in revised data. The index fell by 1.6% in the 12-month period that ended in December 2022, its third year-over-year decline. The index is 19.3% higher than its pre-pandemic level in February 2020, gaining about half the rate that the multifamily sector sub-index gained during that same period.
          






            TRANSACTION VOLUME FELL FOR THE SIXTH CONSECUTIVE MONTH IN DECEMBER 2022, WITH SEGMENTS DIVERGING. Transaction activity fell to $11.2 billion in December, a 2.5% decline from the prior month's upwardly revised volume and the lowest volume since March 2021. This was largely driven by the pull back in investment grade transaction volume which fell by 12.5% in December 2022 over the prior month to $6.6 billion. The general commercial segment volume, which accounted for about 42% of overall transaction activity in December 2022, staged a 16.6% gain over the prior month to $4.7 billion, revised data show.
          



            Composite pair volume of $192.7 billion in the 12-month period ending in December 2022 was 8.5% lower than the 12-month period that ended in December 2021 due to unprecedented transaction activity in December 2021. The decline in annual volume was driven by the 12.5% fall in volume in the investment grade segment, which fell by 12.5% over the 12-month period that ended in December 2022 and accounted for about 64% of the overall annual transaction volume. The investment grade segment, which accounted for about 36% of the 12-month transaction volume, fell by 0.7% over the 12-month period that ended in December 2022.
          






            THE SHARE OF REPEAT-SALE TRADES THAT WERE DISTRESSED REMAINS LOW. Only 33 of the 1,495 repeat-sales trades in December 2022, or about 2.2%, were distressed sales. In comparison, the monthly average share of distressed sales in the five-year period ending in February 2020, prior to the onset of the pandemic, was 3.6%. General commercial distressed sales accounted for 20 of the distressed trades in December 2022, or 1.3% of all repeat-sales trades, below its five-year pre-pandemic monthly average of 2.6%. Only 13 investment grade distressed sales were recorded in the month, accounting for 0.9% of all repeat sales trades, below its five-year pre-pandemic monthly average of 1.1%.

        About The CoStar Commercial Repeat-Sale Indices
      

        The CoStar Commercial Repeat-Sale Indices (CCRSI) are the most comprehensive and accurate measures of commercial real estate prices in the United States. In addition to the national Composite Index (presented in both equal-weighted and value-weighted versions), national Investment-Grade Index, and national General Commercial Index, which are reported monthly, 30 sub-indices in the CoStar index family are reported quarterly. The sub-indices include breakdowns by property sector (office, industrial, retail, multifamily, hospitality, and land), by region of the country (Northeast, South, Midwest, and West), by transaction size and quality (general commercial, investment-grade), and by market size (composite index of the prime market areas in the country).
      

        The CoStar indices are constructed using a repeat sales methodology, widely considered the most accurate measure of price changes for real estate. This methodology measures the movement in the prices of commercial properties by collecting data on actual transaction prices. When a property is sold more than once, a sales pair is created. The prices from the first and second sales are then used to calculate price movement for the property. The aggregated price changes from all the sales pairs are used to create a price index. Historical price indices are revised as new data is recorded.
