CoStar Group, an online real estate marketplace firm that conducts online auctions and negotiated bids, has revealed a digital renovation project including 17 LED screens at its Irvine, California office, according to a press release.SNA Displays used models from its trademarked Brilliant Interior line of LED displays. The lobby installation includes 10 1.2mm staggered-height LEDs. The two auction floor control rooms feature a pair of three-sided 1.2mm LED video walls for live auction monitoring, with a 0.9mm 4K UDH LED wall between the two auction floors."The backend for the LED display systems at the CoStar Irvine office includes SNA Displays equipment, Analog Way processing, and ~sedna playback technology," the company said in the release, leveraging the ~sedna Creator CMS software and three ~sedna 8K Media Engine media servers."The requirement was to drive two enormous 2,160 x 12,960 LED walls independently, as well as a center UHD LED wall," Seth Teates, senior regional sales manager at Analog Way, explained in the release. "Each screen needed a full-resolution native background layer and up to eight 4K layers on-screen at once. The mission-critical, reliable processing of the Aquilon C+ processor was ideal for this scenario, and masterfully installed by SNA Displays' engineering team.""Analog Way's processors and ~sedna's playback technology works in perfect unison with SNA Displays' onsite diagnostics, providing full operational overview of all systems deployed," Pat Green, vice president of systems at SNA Displays, said in the release. "These partners have demonstrated through years of engineering and success stories to be the best suited for this command-and-control environment, ensuring 100% uptime during operation."A video overview of the project is available below.Copyright Â© 2023 Networld Media.
