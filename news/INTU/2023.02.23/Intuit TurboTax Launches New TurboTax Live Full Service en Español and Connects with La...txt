TurboTax, from Intuit (NASDAQ: INTU), the global technology platform that makes TurboTax, QuickBooks, Credit Karma, and Mailchimp, announced today its integrated campaign to connect with Latino taxpayers. Seeking to empower and educate the Hispanic community nationwide, this marketing strategy includes brand advertising, digital and social media activations, public relations efforts, as well as media integrations.

“The U.S. Latino population has become the largest growth minority group in the nation and there is no doubt of their influence on today’s economy,” said Cathleen Ryan, SVP of Marketing for Intuit TurboTax. “TurboTax is committed to understanding their needs and providing in-language and in-culture products and resources that can guide Latino taxpayers through their tax filing experience with confidence and with the support they deserve.”

The Latino brand campaign is an extension of the brand’s “Come to TurboTax” advertising campaign for 2023. It focuses on the company's TurboTax Live offerings, including the new and recently launched TurboTax Live Full Service in Español which comes with fully translated shopping and onboarding experiences, as well as matching to a bilingual tax expert who will prepare, sign and file their taxes. Our Live offerings taps into Intuit’s AI-driven expert platform that matches filers with an experienced bilingual tax expert to handle their unique tax situation and prepare, sign, and file their taxes for them. No more waiting or wondering, just taxes done right and off the mind.

Created by Wieden+Kennedy, the campaign includes Spanish-language spots “Cocinar no es hacer impuestos” and “Pasarla con tus hijos es hacer no taxes” featuring tax filers doing what they do best: not taxes. Both spots invite consumers to stay worry-free and hand over their taxes to a TurboTax Live expert for a full-service experience now available in Spanish. In addition to airing Spanish television spots on Univision, UniMas, Telemundo, Estrella TV among others, TurboTax's 2023 campaign will include the following:

These efforts are being executed in partnership with Hispanic public relations agency Havas FORMULATIN and Influencer agency, GOAT.
