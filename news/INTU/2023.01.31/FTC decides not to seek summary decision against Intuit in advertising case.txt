WASHINGTON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade
Commission voted to deny a motion by the agency's Bureau of
Consumer Protection to seek a summary decision against TurboTax
maker Intuit Inc for engaging in alleged deceptive
advertising, the agency said on Tuesday.Last year, the FTC accused Intuit of deceptively advertising
free tax filing.The FTC determined that a decision on the merits of the case
against Intuit "would be best made after fuller factual
development" during proceedings before an administration law
judge, it said.
