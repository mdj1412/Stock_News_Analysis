4Q22 DSR growth of +10.7% eased on tougher comparisons against the prior period and moderating demand. Against this backdrop and in our slowest seasonal quarter volume-wise, our 4Q22 operating margin was stable at 19.6%. Cash conversion returned to historic levels, reflecting normalization of supply chains.
            

2022 was a year of milestones: our eCommerce revenues surpassed $1.0B of sales; our international sales exceeded $1.0B; and our company-wide net earnings topped $1.0B.
            

Sifting through quarterly noise, our DSR growth has been strong and stable: three-year growth (2019 to 2022) in 1Q22 was 28.1%, 2Q22 was 30.0%, 3Q22 was 30.7%, and 4Q22 was 34.9%. Our three-year incremental margin was 24.1%, and our operating margin rose from 19.8% in 2019 to 20.8% in 2022. We challenged the Blue Team to be better exiting the pandemic than entering it; the Blue Team delivered.

Though headcount finished a little higher than we like, 2022 had strong labor productivity, with FTE growth lagging sales and profit growth due to hiring discipline and a focus on re- stocking our part-time ranks. We expect this to remain a priority in 2023.

Onsites: We had 62 signings in 4Q22 and finished with 1,623 active sites, +14.6% from 4Q21. Daily sales, excluding transferred branch sales, grew at a high-teens rate from 4Q21. Our 2023 goal is 375 to 400 signings.
            

FMI Technology: We signed 4,730 weighted devices in 4Q22 (76 per day), versus 3,972 in 4Q21 (64 per day), with a final installed base of 102,151 weighted devices, +10.0% from 4Q21. Activity through our FMI technology platform represented 38.7% of sales in 4Q22, versus 35.1% of sales in 4Q21 and 27.2% of sales in 4Q20. Our 2023 goal is 23,000 to 25,000 MEU of FASTBin and FASTVend signings.


eCommerce: Daily sales rose 48.2% in 4Q22. Large customer-oriented electronic data interface (EDI) was up 45.0%, while web sales were up 58.8%.
            

Sales through our Digital Footprint (FMI technology plus non-FMI-relatedeCommerce) was 52.6% of sales in 4Q22, versus 46.4% in 4Q21. We anticipate we will hit 65% of our sales running through our Digital Footprint in 2023.

Total in-market1 locations were 3,306 at the end of 4Q22, up 3.0% from 3,209 at 4Q21. Our total in-market location count continues to grow due to a rising installed base of Onsites. In 2015, Onsites constituted 9.1% of our in- market locations; in 2022, they were 49.1%.
            

Since 2015, we have seen a steady reduction in our traditional branches, primarily within the United States. Our focus on Onsites, shifting branch priorities, and the supply chain tools comprising our Digital Footprint have provided opportunities for network consolidation.


Our U.S./Canada network will likely trend toward 1,450 traditional branches by 2025.


At our peak United States branch count in 2013, we believe we had 30-minute access to 95.0% of the U.S. manufacturing base. We anticipate it will approximate 93.5% at our target branch count of 1,450.
            



In-marketlocations include traditional branches, international branches, and Onsites
