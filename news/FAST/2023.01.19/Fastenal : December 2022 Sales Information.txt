Historical averages exclude the impact of the March 2017 acquisition of Mansco. They also exclude 2020, a year during which many months were significantly impacted by COVID-19 surge activity and so would not be considered representative of normal activity.
          

Organizational support personnel consists of: (1) Sales & Growth Driver Support personnel (35%-40% of category), which includes sourcing, purchasing, supply chain, product development, etc.; (2) Information Technology personnel (30%-35% of category); (3) Administrative Support personnel (25%-30% of category), which includes human resources, Fastenal School of Business, accounting and finance, senior management, etc.
          

Due to a calculation error, organizational support personnel was overstated by 36 FTE in our December 2021 sales release, with total non-selling FTE and total FTE being overstated by the same amount. These figures have been adjusted in this release.
            Definitions in release:
            Net sales - Net sales for the period indicated.
            Daily sales - Net sales divided by the number of business days in the US. FTE - Full-time equivalent headcount.
