As the leading authority on the digital economy, Adobe analyzes trillions of real-time online transactions to uncover the most important trends. Today, Adobe has partnered with The Weather Company, an IBM business, to leverage weather data from the world's most accurate forecaster. A new report shows that disruptive weather events (rain, snow and wind) boosts e-commerce by over $13 billion a year when consumers are pushed to stay home-more than what shoppers spend during an entire Cyber Monday.MethodologyAdobe's DPI is modeled after the Consumer Price Index (CPI), published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and uses the Fisher Price Index to track online prices. The Fisher Price Index uses quantities of matched products purchased in the current period (month) and a previous period (previous month) to calculate the price changes by category. Adobe's analysis is weighted by the real quantities of the products purchased in the two adjacent months.Powered by Adobe Analytics, Adobe uses a combination of Adobe's AI and machine learning framework Adobe Sensei and manual effort to segment products into the categories defined by the CPI manual. The methodology was first developed alongside renowned economists Austan Goolsbee and Pete Klenow. Adobe Analytics is part of Adobe Experience Cloud, which over 85% of the top 100 internet retailers in the U.S.* rely upon to deliver, measure and personalize shopping experiences online.About AdobeAdobe is changing the world through digital experiences.
