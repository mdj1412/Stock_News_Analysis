Amgen  announced today the launch of AMJEVITA (adalimumab-atto), a biosimilar to AbbVie's HUMIRA (adalimumab), in the United States. AMJEVITA was the first HUMIRA biosimilar  approved by the FDA and is now the first to be launched in the United States. AMJEVITA is approved to treat seven inflammatory diseases, including moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis in adults, moderate-to-severe polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients 2 years of age and older, psoriatic arthritis in adults, ankylosing spondylitis in adults, moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adults, moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease in adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older and moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis in adults.According to the press release, "AMJEVITA (40 mg) is available at a list price (Wholesale Acquisition Cost) 55% below the current Humira list price.
