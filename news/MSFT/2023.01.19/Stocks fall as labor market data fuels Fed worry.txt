Obviously, the concern becomes, 'do they go too far and do too much and ignore clear signs that the economy is falling into a slow down period.'"Meanwhile, the debt ceiling debate intensified Thursday after the U.S. touched its borrowing limit, prompting the Treasury to start 'extraordinary measures' to keep the government paying its bills.Shares of Procter & Gamble fell more than two percent after the consumer products giant warned that high commodity costs were pressuring profits.Shares of the megacap growth stocks ended mixed with Microsoft and Tesla closing down more than a percent, while Google-parent Alphabet and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms both rose more than two percent.Shares of Netflix ended more than three percent lower, but the stock rebounded in extended trading after the company posted subscriber gains for the quarter and announced that co-founder Reed Hastings would shift roles from chief executive to executive chairman.
