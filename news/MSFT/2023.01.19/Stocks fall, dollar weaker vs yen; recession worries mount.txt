*Wall Street stocks down in early trading*Dollar down vs yen as post-BOJ moves unwind*Oil prices upNEW YORK, Jan 19 (Reuters) -World stocks fell on Thursday as global recession worries
mounted with U.S. Federal Reserve officials maintaining a
hawkish stance, while the dollar declined against the Japanese
yen.Boston Fed President Susan Collins said the Fed will
probably need to raise interest rates to "just above" 5% and
hold them there for a period.She was the latest in a string of Fed officials to
suggest the U.S. central bank needs to remain hawkish to
successfully bring down inflation.Earlier, European Central Bank president Christine
Lagarde pushed up euro zone bond yields slightly by telling the
World Economic Forum's Davos gathering that the bank would stay
the course with rate hikes.Also, Thursday's data showed that overall U.S. housing
starts declined 1.4% to a rate of 1.382 million units last
month. Building permits dropped as well, down 1.6% o a rate of
1.330 million units.Edward Moya, senior market analyst, at OANDA in New York
said, "the housing market is in recession and you're going to
get these regional Fed surveys that are weak and are going to
show that business activity is struggling."Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields bounced off
four-month lows. Benchmark 10-year yields were last
at 3.386%, after earlier dropping to 3.321%, the lowest since
Sept. 13. The yields have fallen from 3.905% at year-end, and
from a 15-year high of 4.338% on Oct. 21.U.S. bond yields had fallen as investors worried that
the U.S. central bank will not be able to raise rates as high
and for as long as it has indicated if the economy soon enters a
downturn.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 208.05
points, or 0.62%, to 33,088.91, the S&P 500 lost 29.64
points, or 0.75%, to 3,899.22 and the Nasdaq Composite
dropped 101.46 points, or 0.93%, to 10,855.55.Microsoft's announcement of 10,000 layoffs also was being
digested, along with more earnings reports on the most recent
quarter. Procter & Gamble raised its full-year sales
forecast and said it plans to continue raising prices.The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 1.34% and
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed
0.90%.Investors were also paying attention to comments from U.S.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who reported using
extraordinary cash management measures to keep borrowing under
the federal debt limit.In the currency markets, the dollar was down 0.4%
against the Japanese yen. Investors were unwinding
some trades from the previous day when the Bank of Japan (BOJ)
surprised markets by sticking with ultra-low interest rates.The BOJ has pursued super-easy policy settings for
decades in an attempt to generate inflation and growth, but
there are doubts it can keep that up, and traders have been
selling Japanese government bonds and buying yen to bet on a
shift.In the energy market, U.S. crude recently rose 0.77%
to $80.09 per barrel and Brent was at $85.75, up 0.91%
on the day.(Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch in New York; additional
