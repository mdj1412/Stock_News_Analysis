after data pointing to a tight labor market sparked worries that
the Federal Reserve will continue with its aggressive
rate-hiking cycle that could potentially tip the economy into a
recession.The Labor Department's report showed a surprise fall in U.S.
weekly jobless claims, highlighting labor market resilience in a
higher interest rate environment.The report did not change expectations that the Fed will
further scale back the size of its interest rate increases next
month, hopes of which were sparked by a slump in retail sales in
December and a retreat in inflation in the previous session.A separate survey of goods producers showed on Thursday
manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region softened again
in January, while data from the Commerce Department confirmed
that the downturn in the housing market persisted."One of the pieces of data that continues to be a conundrum
for the Fed is the tight labor market," said Art Hogan, chief
market strategist at B. Riley in New York."There's virtually no signs of any weakness in the labor
market and that's one of the things the Fed's been leaning
against to keep rates higher for longer."Comments from Fed officials continue to highlight the
disparity between the central bank's estimate of its terminal
rate and market expectations.Boston Fed President Susan Collins joined a chorus of
policymakers to back the case for interest rates to rise beyond
5%.Markets, on the other hand, expect the terminal rate at
4.89% by June and have priced in a 25-basis point rate hike from
the U.S. central bank in February..The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average
