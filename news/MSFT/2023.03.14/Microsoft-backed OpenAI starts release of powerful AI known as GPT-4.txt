March 14 (Reuters) - The startup OpenAI on Tuesday said
it is beginning to release a powerful artificial intelligence
model known as GPT-4, setting the stage for human-like
technology to proliferate and more competition between its
backer Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc's
Google.OpenAI, which created the chatbot sensation ChatGPT, said in
a blog post that its latest technology is "multimodal," meaning
images as well as text prompts can spur it to generate content.
The text-input feature will be available to ChatGPT Plus
subscribers and to software developers, with a waitlist, while
the image-input ability remains a preview of its research.The highly-anticipated launch signals how office workers may
turn to ever-improving AI for still more tasks, as well as how
technology companies are locked in competition to win business
from such advances.Alphabet Inc's Google on Tuesday announced a
"magic wand" for its collaboration software that can draft
virtually any document, days before Microsoft is expected to
showcase AI for its competing Word processor, likely powered by
OpenAI. A Microsoft executive also said that GPT-4 is helping
power its Bing search engine.OpenAI's latest technology in some cases represented a
vast improvement on a prior version known as GPT-3.5, it said.
In a simulation of the bar exam required of U.S. law school
graduates before professional practice, the new model scored
around the top 10% of test takers, versus the older model
ranking around the bottom 10%, OpenAI said.While the two versions can appear similar in casual
conversation, "the difference comes out when the complexity of
the task reaches a sufficient threshold," OpenAI said, noting
"GPT-4 is more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more
nuanced instructions."An online demonstration of the technology by Greg Brockman,
OpenAI's president, showed it could take a photo of a hand-drawn
mock-up for a simple website and create a real website based on
it. GPT-4 also could help individuals calculate their taxes, the
demonstration showed.Sam Altman, OpenAI's chief executive, on Twitter called
GPT-4 its model "most capable and aligned" with human values and
intent, though "it is still flawed."GPT-4 is 82% less likely to respond to requests for
disallowed content than its predecessor and scores 40% higher on
certain tests of factuality, the company said. Inaccurate
responses known as "hallucinations" have been a challenge for
many AI programs.Microsoft stands to benefit from GPT-4's adoption, said
Rishi Jaluria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.The software maker not only is integrating OpenAI's latest
technology into its products: its Azure cloud is powering usage
of OpenAI just as budget-conscious businesses are scrutinizing
IT spend in an uncertain economy, he said."Whenever a company uses this piece of technology," Jaluria
said, "those workloads go through Microsoft Azure, and I think
this is coming at a very critical time."(Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin in Palo Alto, Calif.; Additional
