The year of efficiency is kicking off with a bunch of people getting paid to do nothing."Meta, which also owns WhatsApp, cut more than 11,000 jobs or 13% of its workforce in November. That followed tech companies Amazon and Microsoft, which also announced thousands of layoffs due to the economic downturn.Meta did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment outside of normal business hours.
