tumultuous week as Federal Reserve officials calmed investor
fears over a potential liquidity crisis in the banking sector.While all three major U.S. stock indexes started the
session sharply lower on the heels of asell-offamong European banks, those losses reversed by closing
bell, repeating the intraday roller coaster ride of recent
sessions.At the conclusion of an up-and-down week, marked by a
Fed interest ratehikeand mounting worries over the health of the banking system,
all three indexes notched weekly gains."Equity markets drifted higher as concerns lingered
about another banking flare up in the U.S. or abroad," said
David Carter, managing director at JPMorgan Private Bank in New
York. "Wall Street is taking its cues from Washington and other
capitals as it relates to interest rates and banking
regulations."In separate appearances, three regional Fed bank presidents
said that their confidence that the banking system was not
facing a liquidity crisis is what led to the decision to
implement a 25 basis point policy rate hike on Wednesday.But while Fed officials continue to see additional rate
hikes as a strong possibility, financial markets are now
favoring the likelihood of a no hike at all at the conclusion of
its next policy meeting in May."The Fed may be jaw-boning a bit as it says more rate
increases may be coming this year," JPMorgan's Carter added. "It
helps both their inflation goal and suggests confidence in our
economic system."Worries over potential contagion beyond regional banks
threatening to spread to their larger peers was sparked by a
sell-off of European bank shares.That sell-off was prompted by the rising cost of insuring
Deutsche Bank's debt, expressed by its credit default swaps,
coming on the heels of the state-sponsored buyout of Credit
Suisse, has fed into the narrative of sector-wide stress.But those worries eased by mid-afternoon.While the S&P Bank index ended modestly lower,

or 0.41%, to 32,237.53, the S&P 500 gained 22.27 points,
