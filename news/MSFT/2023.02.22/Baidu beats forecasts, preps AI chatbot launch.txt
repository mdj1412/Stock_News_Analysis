Chief Executive Robin Li said 2022 had been tough.But he said this year offered a clear path towards speeding up growth again.

Dubbed Ernie Bot, it's expected to complete testing in March, and is seen by many as the country's leading rival to the U.S. product.

He says Ernie will first be embedded in Baidu's search engine, saying its Chinese-language abilities are far superior to products developed overseas.
