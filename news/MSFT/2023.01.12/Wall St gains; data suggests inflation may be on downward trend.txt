late afternoon trading Thursday as  data showing a fall in
consumer prices in December bolstered expectations of less
aggressive interest rate hikes.The Labor Department's report showed U.S. consumer prices
grew 6.5% on an annual basis in December, in line with
expectations. While it was the smallest rise since October 2021
and followed a 7.1% advance in November, the headline inflation
number remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target."The report confirms that inflation is in a downward trend
and that it has reversed," said Peter Cardillo, chief market
economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.Trading was choppy initially following the report, with the
indexes mixed following recent strong market gains.But some strategists said the slowdown in U.S. inflation
last month may pave the way for the Fed to be able to bring down
consumer prices without badly damaging growth.Traders' bets of a 25-basis point rate hike by the Fed in
February shot up to 91% after the inflation data, from 77%
previously.Microsoft shares were providing the biggest boost
to the S&P 500, energy shares also were higher along with oil
prices.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 251.07 points,
or 0.74%, to 34,224.08, the S&P 500 gained 19.89 points,
or 0.50%, to 3,989.5 and the Nasdaq Composite added
72.55 points, or 0.66%, to 11,004.22.The Fed raised the key rate by 50 basis points in December,
after four back-to-back 75-bps hikes, but also indicated a
prolonged period of rate hikes to above 5% in 2023.Friday brings results from a number of big U.S. banks,
kicking off the start of the fourth-quarter earnings season for
S&P 500 companies.Overall S&P 500 earnings are expected to have declined
year-over-year in the fourth quarter, according to IBES data
from Refinitiv, which would be the first quarterly U.S. earnings
decline since 2020.A separate report showed weekly jobless claims fell last
week, signaling a still tight labor market.Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker and St. Louis Fed
President James Bullard acknowledged the moderation in prices,
but stressed on the need for further monetary policy tightening
to bring inflation down to the central bank's target.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a
4.18-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.48-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 14 new 52-week highs and one new low; the
Nasdaq Composite recorded 80 new highs and 16 new lows.
