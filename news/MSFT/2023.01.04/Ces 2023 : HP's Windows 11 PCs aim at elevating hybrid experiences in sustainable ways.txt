        At CES 2023, HP announced new Windows 11 PCs focusing on sustainable hybrid experiences, including the new HP Dragonfly Pro, inspired by freelancers and their increasing presence in the U.S. workforce.
      

        This PC, co-engineered with AMD, is the first HP device to provide one-touch access to HP 24/7 live concierge support directly via one of the device's four hot keys. The Control Center hot key delivers quick access to the device's most common settings, while you can easily adjust camera settings with the Camera hot key. You can customize the fourth key to help optimize workflow or simple navigation.
      

        The device is also EPEAT Gold Certified in the U.S., leveraging recycled metals and plastics along with sustainably sourced and recycled packaging [1]. Since HP shipped its first product using recycled materials in 2019, the company has used more than half a billion pounds of recycled materials [2].
      

        With Windows 11's latest update, you'll be able to tap into features such as Focus sessions, snap layouts that make it easier to get things done and the newâ€¯Microsoft Defender SmartScreen to keep you safer on the web.
      

        The HP Dragonfly G4 has new intuitive video conferencing innovations aimed at recharging hybrid work, such as a multi-camera experience that supports dual video streams so faces and whiteboards can be shown at the same time, as in picture-in-picture or side-by-side [3]. The PC also uses intelligent face tracking to recognize which camera a speaker is facing, to keep audiences engaged without breaking contact [3]. To preserve battery life, it learns how you're using the PC and will go into hibernation mode automatically at the end of the workday and can eventually predict when you'll be starting the day to convert to an instant-on experience to help you get going faster.
      

        Continuing the theme of sustainability, the new HP 14 inch Eco Edition Laptop PC was made with up to 25% leveraging recycled and post-consumer recycled plastics. Bio-circular content such as cooking oil was used in the bottom cover of the device, which will also feature packaging that is 100% sustainably sourced and recyclable. Like the other new consumer notebooks HP introduced at CES, it is ENERGY STAR and EPEAT Silver Certified, with the Eco Edition version EPEAT Gold Certified [4].
      

        The HP 24- and 27-inch All-In-One PCs are HP's most sustainable all-in-one offerings yet, with recycled coffee grounds used as speckles in the finish of the PC. More than 40% of this AIO's enclosure contains post-consumer recycled plastics, 75% recycled aluminum is used on the arm stand and 100% reclaimed polyester is used on the stand base. HP has also reduced the 100% sustainably sourced and recyclable box packaging in size by 62%, which translates to up to 66% more units per pallet, reducing the CO2 footprint [5].
      

        The OMEN 17 Laptop, HP's most powerful gaming laptop, has up to 13th Gen Intel Core i9-13900HX and latest NVIDIA GeForce graphics, which utilizes OMEN Tempest Cooling Technology for desktop-caliber gaming. This PC is HP's first to feature optical mechanical keys, which are 25 times faster than traditional keys. Like its consumer and commercial counterparts, the OMEN lineup comes with Windows 11 installed, but it adds a one-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate [6], providing access to hundreds of high-quality PC games.
