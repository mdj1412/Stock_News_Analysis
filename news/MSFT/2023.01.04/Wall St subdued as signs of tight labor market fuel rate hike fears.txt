0.25%Jan 4 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes were
subdued on Wednesday as data showed U.S. job openings fell less
than expected, fuelling investor anxiety about interest rate
hikes ahead of the Federal Reserve's December meeting minutes.A survey from the Labor Department showed job openings fell
54,000 to 10.458 million on the last day of November, compared
with expectations of 10 million job openings.The data indicated a still tight labor market that could
give the Fed cover to keep rates higher for longer.Meanwhile, Apple Inc rose 0.6%, while
electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc jumped 2.3%, with both
the shares recovering from a searing drop in the previous
session.The gains eased some of the pressure on the benchmark S&P
500 index.Microsoft Corp dropped 5.2% following a downgrade
by brokerage UBS on worries over slowing growth for its cloud
services and Office suite.Consumer discretionary stocks rose 0.3%, while the
tech sector fell 0.4%.A separate report showed U.S. manufacturing contracted
further in December. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM)
said its manufacturing PMI dropped to 48.4 last month from 49.0
in November, contracting for a second straight month.Minutes from the Fed's previous meeting, when it raised
interest rates by half a percentage point and cautioned rates
may need to remain higher for longer, are due to be released at
2 p.m. ET (1900 GMT).The Fed minutes could show the central bank's internal
deliberations entering a new phase where risks to economic
growth and employment are given more standing, while curbing
high inflation remains the top priority.U.S. equities were pummeled in 2022 on worries of a
recession due to aggressive monetary policy tightening, with the
three main stock indexes logging their steepest annual losses
since 2008."It's a new year, but we're stuck with the same macro
conditions, which are still pretty discouraging," said Dave
Grecsek, managing director in investment strategy and research
at Aspiriant."Two things that are really going to drive near-term market
returns - whether Fed is going to stick to its word and be as
firm with inflation and policy rates and whether the U.S. and
the European economies enter recession."Market participants see a 68% chance of a 25-basis point
rate hike from the Fed in February, and see rates peaking at
4.99% by June.
