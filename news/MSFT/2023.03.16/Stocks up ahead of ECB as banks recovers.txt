(Alliance News) - Stocks in London traded a little off session highs heading into Thursday afternoon, with investors moving with trepidation in the wake of Credit Suisse's dramatic share price crash on Wednesday and ahead of a European Central Bank interest rate decision. The ECB previously said it would lift rates by 50 basis points, though the fragility of the European banking sector means it may be tempted to enact a quarter-point lift, or even keep rates unchanged. The FTSE 100 index was 65.97 points, 0.9%, higher at 7,410.42 midday Thursday. The FTSE 250 was up 63.75 points, 0.3%, at 18,689.61, but the AIM All-Share was down 1.07 points, 0.1%, at 809.33.The FTSE 100 had been around 1.5% higher in earlier Thursday morning, while the FTSE 250 had been up 1.3%. The Cboe UK 100 was up 0.9% at 741.43. The Cboe UK 250 was up 0.4% to 16,275.76. The Cboe Small Companies was flat at 13,538.36.In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 1.0%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt rose 0.3%. Stocks in New York were called to open mostly lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was called down 0.5%, the S&P 500 down 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.1%. The pound was quoted at USD1.2044 early Thursday afternoon, up slightly from USD1.2030 late Wednesday. The euro stood at USD1.0610, up from USD1.0538. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JPY132.73, higher against JPY132.43."The next test for the markets will be the ECB's interest rate decision later today. It seems unthinkable that it would go for an aggressive 50 basis point hike given the nervousness around the banking system. Opting for a 25 basis point hike would show that it is still on a path to try to bring down inflation but also conscious of the fragility around the financial sector that's caused so much nervousness around the world," AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould commented. "If it went down this path, it would in effect be doing a dress rehearsal for the Federal Reserve next week. The prospect of a 50 basis point hike from the Fed now seems unthinkable. Equally, being overly cautious might send another worrying message."The ECB announces its latest interest rate decision at 1315 GMT, with a press conference featuring President Christine Lagarde following at 1345 GMT.

After suffering a gut punch from the Covid-19 pandemic, the company would have hoped to have been in finer fettle by now. Its recovery will be slower than first thought, however, it warned. "This time last year, we reflected on emerging from the pandemic and indicated that we hoped 2022 would see a return to a more normal trading environment. It is now clear that it will take a longer time to return to pre Covid-19 levels as a result of both the changes to customers' everyday lives and lifestyles and the macroeconomic headwinds that we are all facing," Chief Executive John Treharne said. The low-cost gym operator said revenue for 2022 was 63% higher at GBP172.9 million from GBP106.0 million. Its pretax loss narrowed to GBP19.4 million from GBP44.2 million.
