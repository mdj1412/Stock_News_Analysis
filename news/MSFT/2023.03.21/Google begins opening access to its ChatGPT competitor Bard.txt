March 21 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google on
Tuesday began the public release of its chatbot Bard, seeking
users and feedback to gain ground on Microsoft Corp in
a fast-moving race on artificial intelligence technology.Starting in the U.S. and UK, consumers can join a waiting
list for English-language access to Bard, a program previously
open to approved testers only. Google describes Bard as an
experiment allowing collaboration with generative AI, technology
that relies on past data to create rather than identify content.The release last year of ChatGPT, a chatbot from the
Microsoft-backed startup OpenAI, has caused a sprint in the
technology sector to put AI into more users' hands. The hope is
to reshape how people work and win business in the process.Just last week, Google and Microsoft made a flurry of
announcements on AI, two days apart. The companies are putting
draft-writing technology into their word processors and other
collaboration software, as well as marketing related tools for
web developers to build their own AI-based applications.Asked whether competitive dynamics were behind Bard's
rollout, Jack Krawczyk, a senior product director, said Google
was focused on users. Internal and external testers have turned
to Bard for "boosting their productivity, accelerating their
ideas, really fueling their curiosity," he said.In a demonstration of the site, bard.google.com, to Reuters,
Krawczyk showed how the program produces blocks of text in an
instant, different from how ChatGPT types out answers word by
word.Bard also included a feature showing three different
versions or "drafts" of any given answer among which users could
toggle, and it displayed a button stating "Google it," should a
user desire web results for a query.Unlike ChatGPT, Bard is not proficient in generating
computer code, Google said on its website. Google also said it
has limited Bard's memory of past exchanges in a chat and that
at present it was not using Bard for advertising, core to
Google's business model.Accuracy remains a concern. "Bard will not always get it
right," a Google pop-up notice warned during the demo. Last
month, a promotional video showed the program answering a
question incorrectly, helping shave $100 billion off Alphabet's
market value.Google highlighted a couple mistakes during the
demonstration to Reuters, for instance saying Bard wrongly
claimed ferns required bright, indirect light in response to one
query.Bard also produced nine paragraphs of text when asked for
four in another. After that answer, Krawczyk clicked a
thumbs-down button for feedback."We know the limitations of the technology, and so we want
to be very deliberate at the pace at which we roll this out," he
said.
