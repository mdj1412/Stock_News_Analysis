said on Tuesday.Powell's remarks failed to assuage investors rattled by
remarks from two other Federal Reserve policymakers on Monday.The comments had dampened hopes that inflation in the United
States had peaked and the Fed may soon signal an end to its rate
hiking cycle, bolstered by data last week that showed a
moderation in wage increases."He (Powell) hasn't disrupted the market in any way and the
fact that he stresses the need for political independence while
tackling inflation, that's a definite positive for the markets,"
said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital
Securities, New York."But he has not touched upon or given hints about what the
Fed is going do in the future on rates."Money market bets of a 25-bps hike to in the Fed's upcoming
