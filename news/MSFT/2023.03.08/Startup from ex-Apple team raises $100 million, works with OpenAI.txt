March 8 (Reuters) - Humane Inc, a startup founded by
former Apple Inc employees, said on Wednesday it has
raised $100 million and will release its first products this
spring.The company, founded in 2018 by Imran Chaudhri and Bethany
Bongiorno, has now raised $241 million but has yet to disclose
what it is building, saying only that it is a "software platform
and consumer device built from the ground up for artificial
intelligence."A video posted by the company and patent filings suggest
that a wearable device will project information onto the real
world and allow users to manipulate that information with their
hands.Humane also said that it is collaborating with OpenAI, the
creator of AI products such as ChatGPT that can generate
human-like conversational text and Dall-E that can generate
images, to integrate OpenAI's technology into Humane's device.Sam Altman, OpenAI's founder and a previous Humane investor,
participated in funding round on Wednesday, the company said.Humane also said that Microsoft Corp, which has
built a massive cloud computing infrastructure specifically for
AI, took part in the funding round.Humane said it will partner with Microsoft's cloud to bring
Humane's software services platform to market."Our products are built on an integrated device and cloud
platform that will allow us, and others, to create AI-driven
experiences that feel natural, fun and needed," Patrick Gates,
another Apple veteran who is Humane's chief technology officer,
said in a statement.Humane also said that it is working with Korean electronics
giant LG Electronics Inc "on potential (research and
development) projects for the next phase of Humane products" and
with Volvo Car's Tech Fund on "a potential future
collaboration which would be the first example of Humaneâ€™s
offering being applied to the automotive industry."
