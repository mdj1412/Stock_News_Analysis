economic data and hawkish comments from Federal Reserve
officials sparked worries that the central bank may not pause
interest rate hikes any time soon.Before the market opened, U.S. economic data showed retail
sales and producer prices declined more than expected in
December. Also production at U.S. factories fell more than
expected in December and output in the prior month was weaker
than previously thought.With Wall Street's major averages showing gains so far for
2023, Sam Stovall, chief investment  strategist at CFRA
research, said some investors saw the week data as an
opportunity to take profits while others worried about the
prospects for a recession."The market was overbought. Today's economic data served
as a trigger to initiate a profit taking spell and the groups
with most profits to take have been the ones that have done best
last year," said Stovall.By 2:14PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell
434.27 points, or 1.28%, to 33,476.58, the S&P 500 lost
42.57 points, or 1.07%, to 3,948.4 and the Nasdaq Composite
dropped 87.02 points, or 0.78%, to 11,008.10.The weakest sectors on the day are the defensive consumer
staples, down more than 2%, and utilities,
which was last down 1.8%.The benchmark S&P and the blue-chip Dow were both on track
for their second straight day of losses, while the Nasdaq, if it
ends lower, would snap a seven-day winning streak.U.S. stocks had started 2023 on a strong footing, with the
S&P having closed up almost 4% year-to-date on Tuesday, on hopes
that a moderation in inflationary pressures could give the Fed
cover to dial down the size of its interest rate hikes.Roughly halfway through January, the S&P was up 2.7% for
the month so far while the Nasdaq was up more than 5% and the
Dow, the best performer of the three for 2022, was up 0.9%.Earlier, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester stressed on the need to
raise rates beyond 5% to bring inflation to heel.The Fed commentary also highlighted the disparity between
the U.S. central bank's estimate of its terminal rate and market
expectations, which were of the rate peaking at 4.88% by June.
Traders are now betting on a 25-basis point rate hike in
February."This market is very hopeful that we're going to get a soft
landing and every time you have hawkish comments from the Fed,
it feels you're not going to get that," Dennis Dick, trader at
Triple D Trading.Investors are also focused on the fourth-quarter earnings
season as a window into how corporate America is doing against
the backdrop of higher interest rates.Analysts now expect year-over-year earnings from S&P 500
companies to decline 2.6% for the quarter, according to
Refinitiv data, compared with a 1.6% decline in the beginning of
the year.IBM Corp was down 2.6% after Morgan Stanley
downgraded the company's shares to "equal weight" from
"overweight".Early gainers Microsoft Corp and Tesla Inc
erased gains by late afternoon trading with Microsoft down 1.2%
and Tesla off 2.7%.Moderna Inc rose 3.6% after reporting data which
demonstrated the effectiveness of its respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV) vaccine.PNC Financial Services Group Inc was down 5.4% after
the company missed estimates for fourth-quarter profit.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a
1.38-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.66-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&P 500 posted 9 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows;
the Nasdaq Composite recorded 71 new highs and 14 new lows.
