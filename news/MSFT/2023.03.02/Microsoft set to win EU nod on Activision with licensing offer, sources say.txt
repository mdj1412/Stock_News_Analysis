BRUSSELS, March 2 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is
expected to secure EU antitrust approval for its $69 billion
acquisition of Activision with its offer of licensing
deals to rivals, three people familiar with the matter said,
helping it to clear a major hurdle.Microsoft announced the Activision bid in January last year,
its biggest ever, to take on leaders Tencent and Sony
, in the booming videogaming market and to venture in
the metaverse which is virtual online worlds where people can
work, play and socialise.The European Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the
deal by April 25, is not expected to demand that Microsoft sell
assets to win its approval, the people said.In addition to the licensing deals for rivals, Microsoft may
also have to offer other behavioural remedies to allay concerns
of other parties than Sony, one of the people said. Such
remedies typically refer to the future conduct of the merged
company.Activision shares, which jumped 1.8% in pre-market trading
after the Reuters' story was published, were up 2.6% in late
trade.Microsoft President Brad Smith last month said the U.S.
software group was ready to offer rivals licensing deals to
address antitrust concerns but it would not sell Activision's
lucrative "Call of Duty" franchise.Smith said it was not feasible or realistic to think that
one game or one slice of Activision can be carved out and
separated from the rest.The EU competition enforcer declined to comment.Microsoft said it was "committed to offering effective and
easily enforceable solutions that address the European
Commission's concerns.""Our commitment to grant long term 100% equal access to
Call of Duty to Sony, Steam, NVIDIA and others preserves the
deal's benefits to gamers and developers and increases
competition in the market," a Microsoft spokesperson said.Last month, Microsoft said it had signed 10-year licensing
deals with Nintendo and Nvidia that will bring
Call of Duty to their gaming platforms, with the agreements
conditional on a green light for the Activision deal.The deal faces regulatory headwinds in Britain, where the UK
competition agency has suggested that Microsoft divests Call of
Duty to address its concerns while the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) has asked a judge to block the deal.
