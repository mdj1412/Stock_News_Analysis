choppy trading session on Tuesday, as investors digested
comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell about how long
central bank may need to tame inflation.Powell said 2023 should be a year of "significant declines
in inflation."His comments fed investor hopes for less aggressive monetary
policy that were stymied after a strong U.S. jobs report last
Friday. "We didn't expect it to be this strong," Powell said at
the Economic Club of Washington, referring to the nonfarm
payrolls report for January, but it "shows why we think this
will be a process that takes quite a bit of time.""Powell expects they're not going to be cutting rates
anytime soon, but that there is a good path, that they’re
accomplishing what they need to accomplish,” said Shawn Cruz,
head trading strategist at TD Ameritrade.Wall Street's main indexes fluctuated wildly during and
after Powell's remarks, and analysts said volatility is unlikely
to dissipate soon."Until we see softening and inflation throughout the economy
and throughout the globe, it's going to be hard to push the
markets up in a decisive fashion," said Carol Schleif, deputy
chief investment officer at BMO Family Office.The tech-heavy Nasdaq rallied and the S&P 500
also got a boost from Microsoft Corp. The company's
shares rose as it unveiled an integration of ChatGPT, a chatbot
from OpenAI, into its products.Following Powell's comments, Morgan Stanley said it added 25
basis point to its forecast for the May policy meeting, but
continued to expect the first 25 basis point rate cut for
December, 2023.The Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points last week,
with markets now pricing in a peak rate above 5% after Friday's
strong jobs data.U.S.-listed shares of Baidu Inc soared as the
Chinese search engine said it would conclude testing of its
ChatGPT-style project "Ernie Bot" in March.The top 11 sectors on the S&P 500 presented mixed
performances, but technology was among top gainers.Among top gainers on the Dow Jones Industrial Average
, Boeing Inc went up after the U.S. planemaker
confirmed it expects to cut about 2,000 white-collar jobs.According to preliminary data, the S&P 500
gained 52.99 points, or 1.29%, to end at 4,164.07 points,
while the Nasdaq Composite gained 225.16 points, or
1.89%, to 12,112.61. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
rose 266.99 points, or 0.79%, to 34,158.01.On Monday, U.S. stock indexes were dragged by views that
rates would stay higher for longer. Still, all three major
averages are in the black for 2023, with the Nasdaq adding over
15%, led by a revival in battered mega-cap growth stocks.So far, more than half of the companies on the S&P 500 have
reported quarterly earnings, with 69.1% of them beating
expectations, according to Refinitiv. Still, analysts expect
fourth-quarter earnings to decline 3.1%.DuPont De Nemours Inc jumped on a
higher-than-expected quarterly profit supported by higher
pricing for its products.Bed Bath & Beyond plunged as the home-goods
retailer seeks a $1 billion raise in a last-ditch effort to
avoid bankruptcy.Later on Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden will deliver the
annual State of the Union address to a joint session of
Congress.
