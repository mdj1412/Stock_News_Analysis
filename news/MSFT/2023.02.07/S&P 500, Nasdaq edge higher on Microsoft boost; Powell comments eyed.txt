by gains in Microsoft shares, while investors awaited comments
from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to assess the central
bank's stance on monetary policy.Powell's Q&A at the Economic Club of Washington is due at
12:40 p.m. EST (1740 GMT). The session will be in focus after a
strong jobs report last week stymied rising hopes of less
aggressive monetary policy."It looks like we're continuing to see a cautious tone for
markets ever since the jobs report on Friday," said Chris
Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor
Alliance.Traders are speculating that the central bank would push the
benchmark rate to 5.1% in June, levels that policymakers have
backed vociferously.Boosting the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&P 500
was Microsoft Corp. The company's shares added
2.6% on speculations that the megacap company would unveil an
integration of ChatGPT, a chatbot from OpenAI, into its
products.U.S.-listed shares of Baidu Inc soared 10.7% as the
Chinese search engine said it would conclude the testing of its
ChatGPT-style project 'Ernie Bot' in March.Six of the top 11 sectors on the S&P 500 fell, but
technology was among top gainers, up 0.9%."Artificial intelligence and the idea of ChatGPT has
really struck a chord with investors, and people are starting to
really look to AI as potentially the next big trend," Zaccarelli
added.Among top gainers on the Dow Jones Industrial Average
, Boeing Inc climbed 2.2% after the U.S. planemaker
confirmed it expects to cut about 2,000 white-collar jobs.Views that rates would stay higher for longer dragged
U.S. stock indexes down on Monday. But, all three major averages
are in the black for 2023, with the Nasdaq adding over 13%, led
by a revival in battered mega-cap growth stocks.So far, more than half of the companies on the S&P 500 have
reported quarterly earnings, with 69.1% of them beating
expectations, according to Refinitiv. Still, analysts expect
fourth-quarter earnings to decline 3.1%.At 12:22 p.m. ET, the Dow was down 67.04 points, or
0.20%, at 33,823.98, the S&P 500 was up 2.60 points, or 0.06%,
at 4,113.68, and the Nasdaq was up 28.93 points, or 0.24%, at
11,916.38.DuPont De Nemours Inc jumped 5.6%, on a
higher-than-expected quarterly profit supported by higher
pricing for its products.Bed Bath & Beyond plunged 45.0% as the embattled
home-goods retailer seeks a $1 billion raise in a last-ditch
effort to avoid bankruptcy.Later into the day, U.S. President Joe Biden will deliver
the annual State of the Union address to a joint session of
Congress.Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.27-to-1
ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.47-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The S&P index recorded two new 52-week highs and two new
lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 52 new highs and 23 new lows.
