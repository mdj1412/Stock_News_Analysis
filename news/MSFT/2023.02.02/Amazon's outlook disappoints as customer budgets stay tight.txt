Feb 2 (Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc on Thursday forecast operating
profit may continue to slump in the current quarter, as mass
layoffs at the retailer only dent the financial impact of
consumers and cloud customers clamping down on spending.And while Amazon's holiday revenue beat Wall Street's
expectations, sales growth from its lucrative cloud-computing
division slowed during the fourth quarter.Shares fell 5% in after-hours trade, erasing their 7%
gain before the market's close Thursday.Facing high inflation and an uncertain economy, CEO Andy
Jassy has aimed to slash costs across Amazon's vast array of
businesses.Last month, he announced more than 18,000 employees
particularly in its commerce and human resources divisions would
lose their jobs. Amazon likewise has scaled back or shut down
entire services like its virtual primary care offering for
employers.At the same time, Amazon is seeking new revenue in the
face of higher gas and consumer prices that have discouraged
shoppers from splurging online, especially in Europe. The
company plans to charge certain grocery delivery fees for U.S.
Prime members, on top of recent price hikes to join the loyalty
program; it has created an add-on generic-drug subscription to
attract business as well.Despite this, Amazon forecast it would earn between $0
and $4 billion in operating income this quarter, compared with
$3.7 billion in the same period a year prior and $4.04 billion
analysts were expecting, according to research firm FactSet.In a press release, Jassy said the company was making
progress on cost cutting."In the short term, we face an uncertain economy, but we
remain quite optimistic about the long-term opportunities for
Amazon," he said.Amazon's outlook is in particular tied to the fortunes
of its cloud-computing division. Long a major source of profit,
Amazon Web Services has seen sales growth slow down, and
industry executives, including at rival Microsoft Corp
have said economic uncertainty has prompted enterprises to
rethink how much they're willing to spend on cloud.The division fell short of estimates of more than $22
billion in fourth-quarter cloud sales, increasing them 20% to
$21.4 billion.An October sale to encourage early holiday shopping on
Amazon helped with retail revenue, to a point. The company's
total net sales were $149.20 billion in the fourth quarter,
compared with analysts' expectations of $145.42 billion,
according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
