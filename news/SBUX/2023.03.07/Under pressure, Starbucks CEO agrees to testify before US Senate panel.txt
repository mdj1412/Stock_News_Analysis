(Adds comments from Starbucks executive and labor union)WASHINGTON, March 7 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp
interim Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz has agreed to
testify this month before a U.S. Senate committee after earlier
resisting requests to appear and answer questions about the
company's compliance with labor law.Schultz will testify on March 29 before the Senate Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, the company and panel
chairman Senator Bernie Sanders said on Tuesday. Schultz, who is
stepping down from his post this month, had earlier declined an
invitation from 11 senators to testify before the panel on March
9.Committee Democrats had scheduled a vote for Wednesday -
canceled after Schultz agreed to testify - on issuing a subpoena
to compel Schultz's appearance. The company previously offered
other executives to speak instead.Over the years, Schultz helped Starbucks build a
reputation as a progressive employer, offering higher salaries
and more benefits - including company stock and health insurance
- than other restaurant chains.But the company's response to a growing union campaign,
as well some of Schultz's public comments, have been described
by some critics, including some shareholders, as overly
aggressive.Democratic lawmakers have accused Starbucks of illegally
firing pro-union employees and shuttering freshly unionized
stores, which the company denies."Despite the fact that over 280 Starbucks coffee shops
have successfully voted to form a union over the past year,
Starbucks has refused to negotiate in good faith to sign a
single first contract with their employees," Sanders said in a
statement.At its March 23 annual shareholder meeting, Starbucks
investors will vote on a proposal for an external audit of the
chain's labor policies. Two top proxy advisers have recommended
'yes' votes on the proposal, and Starbucks has since said it is
conducting its own review.UNION POLICIESAs head of the company, Schultz was not involved in making
decisions about labor law, instead delegating them to other
executives, Starbucks' Executive Vice President and Chief
Communications Officer AJ Jones II said in an interview.The company had made 17 requests in the past to meet
with Sanders' staff to discuss unions, before finally being
granted a meeting on Feb. 17, he said.Jones said he and other Starbucks representatives met again
with Sanders' staff on Monday.Schultz plans to testify about how Starbucks has led the
industry in offering higher wages and better benefits, and will
discuss "who we are as a company... and what we stand for," he
said.In a statement, Starbucks Workers United, the Service
Employees International Affiliate organizing most of the newly
unionized Starbucks cafes, said it looked forward to hearing
from Schultz."As the architect of Starbucks' unprecedented anti-union
campaign, it is high time for him to be held accountable for his
actions," the union said.Employees at more than 280 of Starbucks' roughly 9,000
company-operated U.S. locations have voted to join a labor union
since 2021. The union is seeking better pay and benefits,
improved health and safety conditions and protections against
unfair dismissal and discipline.Sanders said that the U.S. National Labor Relations Board
has issued more than 80 complaints against Starbucks for
violating federal labor law. Sanders also noted that an
administrative law judge in New York has ruled that the company
engaged in "egregious and widespread misconduct" in the union
organizing campaign.(Reporting by Kanishka Singh and David Shepardson in Washington
