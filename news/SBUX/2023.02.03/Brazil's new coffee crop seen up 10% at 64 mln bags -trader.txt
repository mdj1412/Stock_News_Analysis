NEW YORK, Feb 3 (Reuters) -The new coffee crop (2023/24) in the world's largest
producer and exporter Brazil was projected on Friday to reach 64
million 60-kg bags, or a 10.2% increase over the previous crop,
according to estimates released by coffee trader Comexim.The trader, which is one of the largest exporters of
Brazilian coffee, said it expects the country's exports in the
new season to grow 12.6% over the previous crop to 41.5 million
bags.Comexim estimates that Brazil's arabica coffee production
will grow 15.8% in 2023/24 versus the previous crop to 41.3
million bags, while it sees robusta coffee output growing only
1.3% to 22.7 million bags.Arabica coffee is the milder variety preferred by
high-end coffee chains such as Starbucks, while robusta coffee
is mostly used to make instant coffee.Comexim also revised downwards its estimate for the
current, 2022/23, Brazilian crop to 58.05 million bags from 63.2
million bags projected initially."Perhaps we were originally a bit too optimistic in the
recovery and underestimated the weather impacts," it said about
the revision.The trader expects a 500,000-bag increase in the
Brazilian coffee consumption to 22 million bags in 2023/24.Brazil is the second largest coffee consumer, after the
United States.Comexim projects a tight carry-over stocks into the new
season that starts in July at only around 1 million bags, but it
sees potential for a larger production in Brazil in the 2024/25
season."It is also important to point-out that the 23/24 coffee
crop in Brazil, is an off-cycle year. Meaning that should all
factors fall into place (price, weather, etc), we could be
setting the stage for an even bigger 24/25 season," it said.Brazil's arabica production alternates years of high and
lower volumes. The harsh frosts in 2021 changed that pattern,
since they hurt the 2022/23 crop, which should have been a
'on-year' in the cycle.
