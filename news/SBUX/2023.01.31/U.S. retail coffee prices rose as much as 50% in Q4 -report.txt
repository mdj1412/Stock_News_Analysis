NEW YORK, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Retail prices in the United
States for roast and ground coffee,  the most popular type sold,
rose as much as 50% in the fourth quarter of 2022 from a year
earlier, as companies tried to offset higher costs, a report
said on Tuesday.The increase of 50% was seen for Folgers, one of the market
leaders, and led to a reduction of 17% in volumes sold, although
the company managed to increase revenues from those sales due to
the higher prices, according to a report by the research arm of
Rabobank with data from IRI.Other well-known coffee brands also increased roast and
ground prices sharply in the period. Maxwell House boosted them
35% and Starbucks around 15%, the report said, as they tried to
maintain revenue despite higher costs with coffee beans, labor,
energy and packaging."I have been a beverage analyst for 16 years and have never
seen price increases this large," said Jim Watson, executive
director, Beverages Research at RaboResearch.Watson said the roast and ground category saw industry's the
highest price increases, mostly because green coffee is a higher
percentage of total cost than in other coffee categories.Green coffee prices surged last year to the highest
in 11 years after frosts sharply reduced production in top
grower Brazil.Overall in the United States, prices for coffee in all
categories increased on average nearly 20% in the last quarter
year-on-year. Volumes sold fell around 5% as a result.Watson does not see the fall in volumes as too bad
considering the scale of price increases.He sees cost pressures remaining high in 2023."Our green coffee forecasts show a slight decline from
current prices, which are below 2022 levels, but well-above the
previous 10 years".The United States is the world's largest coffee consumer and
importer.
