Moreover, we have secured lower cost of goods sold going forward and a greater pathway to gross margin improvement and stability. Our Q4 and FY 2022 results reflected a business that was operating well below optimal capacity, and not yet reflective of the significant strategic initiatives we have undertaken and those that we are prepared to implement. In fiscal Q1 2023, we will begin to see some of the financial impact of the $17 million in cash savings we expected from recent strategic initiatives. We anticipate more significant improvements in our financial metrics will develop through fiscal Q2 and Q3 of 2023, as we endeavour to achieve positive cash flow from operations.'Consolidated net revenue was $13.6 million in Q4 2022 as compared to $10.4 million in Q4 2021, a 31% increase. Consolidated net revenue was $47.1 million for FY 2022 as compared to $42.7 million for FY 2021, a 10% increase. Growth in net revenue for both periods was driven by the Flow brand growth in retail and e-commerce channels in North America, while co-packing revenue contributed to growth in Q4 2022, Flow experienced reduced customer demand for co-packing services in FY 2022 as compared to FY 2021. The Company achieved Flow brand net revenue growth of 26% in FY 2022, as compared to its financial target of 25% - 30%, and 37% in the second half of FY 2022, as compared to its financial target of 35% - 45%.Gross margin was 10% in Q4 2022, as compared to 21% in Q4 2021.

Normalized gross margin was 28% in Q4 2022 and 25% in FY 2022, adjusting for $2.2 million in take-or-pay payments that would have been payable under a previous co-packing agreement and $0.3 million of inventory reserve.Flow reported an EBITDA Loss of $12.0 million in Q4 2022, a 10% increase from Q4 2021, and a loss of $36.1 million for FY 2022, a 29% improvement from FY 2021. The improvement in EBITDA Loss is attributable to a significant reduction in stock-based compensation and cost discipline in both periods, offset by the factors impacting gross margin, higher warehousing and logistics costs, and higher trade marketing expenses in Q4 2022. Included in Q4 2022 EBITDA Loss is $2.8 million in non-cash charges related to inventory, trade credit reserves and accrual for doubtful accounts.
