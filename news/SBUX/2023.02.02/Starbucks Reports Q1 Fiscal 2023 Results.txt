Starbucks Corporation (Nasdaq: SBUX) today reported financial results for its 13-week fiscal first quarter ended January 1, 2023. GAAP results in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 include items that are excluded from non-GAAP results. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures at the end of this release for more information.

Q1 Fiscal 2023 Highlights

“Starbucks performance in Q1 demonstrates the strength and resilience of our business and accelerating demand for Starbucks Coffee all around the world," said Howard Schultz, interim ceo. “We posted today's strong results despite challenging global consumer and inflationary environments, a soft quarter for retail overall and the unprecedented, COVID-related headwinds that unfolded in China in Q1,” Schultz added.

“I am very proud of what we achieved in Q1, with nearly every business segment contributing to our strong performance,” commented Rachel Ruggeri, chief financial officer. “And I’m pleased to share that our fiscal 2023 guidance remains unchanged, despite the headwinds from China,” Ruggeri added.

(1) In this release, we estimate the impact of headwinds from China by comparing actual results to our previous forecasts and excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. These forecasts were created prior to Q1 FY23 and were based on information available at the time and on a variety of assumptions which we believe were reasonable, some or all of which may prove not to be accurate.

Includes only Starbucks® company-operated stores open 13 months or longer. Comparable store sales exclude the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and Siren Retail stores. Stores that are temporarily closed or operating at reduced hours due to the COVID-19 pandemic remain in comparable store sales.

Net revenues for the North America segment grew 14% over Q1 FY22 to $6.6 billion in Q1 FY23, primarily driven by a 10% increase in company-operated comparable store sales, driven by a 9% increase in average ticket and a 1% increase in transactions, net new store growth of 3% over the past 12 months and strength in our licensed store sales.

Operating income increased to $1.2 billion in Q1 FY23 compared to $1.1 billion in Q1 FY22. Operating margin of 18.5% contracted from 18.9% in the prior year, primarily driven by previously committed investments in labor including enhanced store partner wages and benefits, as well as higher commodity and supply chain costs due to inflationary pressures. This contraction was partially offset by strategic pricing and sales leverage.

Includes only Starbucks® company-operated stores open 13 months or longer. Comparable store sales exclude the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and Siren Retail stores. Stores that are temporarily closed or operating at reduced hours due to the COVID-19 pandemic remain in comparable store sales while stores identified for permanent closure have been removed.

Net revenues for the International segment declined 10% over Q1 FY22 to $1.7 billion in Q1 FY23, primarily driven by approximately 13% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, as well as a 13% decline in comparable store sales, primarily attributable to suppressed mobility in China. These decreases were partially offset by growth in our licensed store revenue including higher product sales and royalty revenues, as well as net new store growth of 8% over the past 12 months.

Operating income decreased to $240.4 million in Q1 FY23 compared to $299.6 million in Q1 FY22. Operating margin of 14.3% contracted from 16.0% in the prior year, primarily driven by sales deleverage in China. This contraction was partially offset by sales leverage across markets outside of China, lapping amortization expenses and business mix.

Net revenues for the Channel Development segment grew 15% over Q1 FY22 to $478.2 million in Q1 FY23, driven by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance and global ready-to-drink business.

Operating income increased to $226.3 million in Q1 FY23 compared to $183.2 million in Q1 FY22. Operating margin of 47.3% expanded from 43.9% in the prior year, primarily due to strength in our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture income.

Non-GAAP Disclosure

In addition to the GAAP results provided in this release, the company provides certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, or alternatives for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP general and administrative expenses (G&A), non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating income growth, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP earnings per share exclude the below-listed items and their related tax impacts, as they do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company’s future operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to non-GAAP G&A, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating income growth, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP earnings per share are general and administrative expenses, operating income, operating income growth, operating margin, effective tax rate and diluted net earnings per share, respectively.

Non-GAAP Exclusion

Rationale

Restructuring and impairment costs

Management excludes restructuring and impairment costs for reasons discussed above. These expenses are anticipated to be completed within a finite period of time.

Transaction and integration-related costs

Management excludes transaction and integration costs, primarily amortization, of the acquired intangible assets for reasons discussed above. Additionally, we incur certain costs associated with certain divestiture activities. These costs are expected to be recognized over a finite period of time.

Non-GAAP G&A, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating income growth, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP earnings per share may have limitations as analytical tools. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company’s results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than the company does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
