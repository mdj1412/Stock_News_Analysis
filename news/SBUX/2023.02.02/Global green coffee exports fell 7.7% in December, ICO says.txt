NEW YORK, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The total amount of coffee
exported in the world fell 7.7% in December compared to the same
month a year earlier to 9.81 million bags, mainly due to smaller
shipments of the arabica type, the International Coffee
Association (ICO) said on Thursday.In its monthly market report, the ICO said that exports of
Brazilian Naturals (arabica coffee) fell 10.3% in December while
shipments of Colombian Milds decreased by 7.5%. Arabica coffee
is the milder type of the beverage preferred by high-end coffee
chains such as Starbucks.The report said that exports of robusta coffee, widely used
to make instant coffee, rose to 4.25 million bags in December
compared to 4.21 million bags a year earlier.The ICO did not comment on the reasons for the movement, but
analysts have noted gains in market share for robustas, which
are cheaper than arabicas.Popular coffee brands tend to increase the amount of robusta
that they blend with arabica when prices for the latest are
high, such as currently.
