      Today, on the first day of Milan Fashion Week 2023, Howard Schultz, Starbucks founder and interim chief executive officer, and Carlo Capasa, Chairman of the National Chamber of Italian Fashion (Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana) hosted an invitation-only dinner at the Starbucks Reserve® Roastery in Milan to introduce Starbucks Oleato™.
    

      At the event, guests sampled Oleato, a new line of beverages features Starbucks coffee infused with Partanna extra virgin olive oil. The new beverages are making their debut Feb. 22 at the Starbucks Reserve Roastery Milan and in Starbucks stores in Italy, followed by Southern California in the United States this spring. Later this year select markets in Japan, the Middle East, the United Kingdom will launch the beverages.
