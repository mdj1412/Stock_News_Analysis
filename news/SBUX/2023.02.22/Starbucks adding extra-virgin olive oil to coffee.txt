Inspired by interim CEO Howard Schultz's trip to Milan, Starbucks has unveiled a line of coffee beverages — Oleato — infused with a spoonful of Partanna cold-pressed, extra-virgin olive oil.While on his trip, Schultz discovered a family tradition that has existed in regions of Italy for generations — enjoying a spoonful of extra virgin olive oil each day as an uplifting ritual. The result is velvety smooth, delicately sweet and lush coffee that uplifts each cup with an extraordinary new flavor and texture, according to Schultz."During my first trip to Milan in 1983, I was captivated by the sense of community, connection, and passion for coffee I found in the city's espresso bars," he said in a company press release. "It was that trip that inspired me to bring the ritual of handcrafted espresso to Starbucks and to America."Dubbed Oleato, Schultz said he feels just as inspired as he did 40 years ago."Oleato has opened our eyes to fresh new possibilities and a transformational way to enjoy our daily coffee," he said.Starbucks Oleato beverages that will be served in Starbucks stores around the world and include:"When creating the beverages, we were inspired by the rich history and origin stories of coffee and olive oil — two of nature's most transcendent ingredients," Amy Dilger, principal beverage developer for Starbucks, said in the release. "Infusing Starbucks coffee with olive oil yielded a velvety smooth, rich texture, with the buttery, round flavors imparted by the olive oil perfectly pairing with the soft, chocolatey notes of the coffee.""One thing that's special about Partanna's olives is their uniquely nutty, slightly sweet flavors — think of that rich smoothness of a buttery caramel, it's a natural complement to our coffee. Whether you enjoy Oleato hot or cold, you get this really luxurious, textural experience."Starbucks Coffee Company has 36,000 stores worldwide.Copyright © 2023 Networld Media.
