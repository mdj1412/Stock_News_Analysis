Biggby Coffee, a 340-unit Michigan-based concept, has hired Michele Waits, an 11-year Starbucks exec, as CMO. Most recently, she served as VP of marketing and commercial support for illycaffè North America."Its emphasis on being mission-driven and delivering a custom-crafted consumer experience is what makes Biggby Coffee so unique," Waits said in a company press release. "We offer a combination of great coffee and friendly service in a simple and unpretentious way that, I think, is really consistent with what consumers want today."Just as the chain offers customers coffee however they want it, Waits' marketing strategy will take a similar approach. By leveraging personalized digital marketing and a social media presence, the brand will be able to connect with its customers how and where they prefer."Personalized digital marketing delivered through an app is a perfect way to be able to extend the 'any way you want it' conversation that we have in our stores to deliver a great customer experience outside of the stores as well," she said in the release."Michele brings a remarkable professional history to the team," Michael McFall, co-founder and co-CEO, said in the release. "As we work to drive the brand forward, her insights will empower the marketing team to connect with our customers in a more individualized way, streamlining and modernizing our efforts."Copyright © 2023 Networld Media.
