NEW YORK, March 23 (Reuters) -Starbucks, which has faced criticism over its opposition to
union organizing, wants to be "a different kind of company" that
cares for its frontline workers, new CEO Laxman Narasimhan told
employees on Thursday before the coffee chain's annual meeting.In a letter to workers, Narasimhan said Starbucks'
performance was strong but the company needs to strengthen its
health. "We must care for" customer-facing staff, he wrote."We strive to be a different kind of company operating in a
different kind of world," he said, adding Starbucks plans to
"reinvigorate" its employee culture.His comments came the day after Starbucks workers walked off
the job at 100 stores around the United States, and a video
posted by the union on social media showed hundreds of activists
marching in protest outside company headquarters.The former PepsiCo and Reckitt Benckiser executive, who
joined the company in October, took over on Monday as Howard
Schultz stepped down from his third stint as CEO of the chain he
helped turn into a global coffee behemoth.Narasimhan must contend with the company's divisive
record on labor unions, an issue of increasing concern to
politicians and shareholders.The company has said it complies with U.S. labor law. It has
accused the union of failing to bargain in good faith and the
National Labor Relations Board of running unfair elections that
favored the union.Schultz is scheduled to testify next week before a U.S.
Senate committee on the topic.Investors voted Thursday on a shareholder proposal for an
independent review of Starbucks' practices on union organizing
and collective bargaining.The company did not disclose results of the voting.During the meeting, acting executive vice president and
general counsel Zabrina Jenkins addressed the proposal, saying
the company is conducting an independent assessment "that will
include a deeper level review of the principles of freedom of
association and the right to collective bargaining. This
represents a much broader commitment than the shareholder
proposal requests."Jonas Kron, chief advocacy officer at shareholder
Trillium Asset Management, one of the investors that made the
proposal, said this was the first time he had heard that
argument.Jenkins' comments "didn't provide clarity" and were
"very vague," Kron said.But Narasimhan taking over "is a real opportunity for a
pivot" on unions, he said.Much of the meeting consisted of a video showing
Narsimhan's last six months with the company, visiting coffee
farmers, suppliers and cafes around the world, donning a green
apron and giving fist bumps and high fives to baristas.LABOR STRIFESince late 2021, workers at more than 290 U.S.
corporate-owned locations have voted to unionize. Unionized
employees say the company illegally retaliated against union
organizers with firings and store closures.Hundreds of pro-union baristas and supporters protested
outside Starbucks' Seattle headquarters on Wednesday, according
to Starbucks Workers United and video on social media.Chanting and carrying signs reading "seize the beans of
production" and "be kind to your workers," baristas urged the
company to increase staffing and schedule the workers for more
hours so they could qualify for health insurance benefits."Stop union busting and show up to the bargaining table,"
barista Hailey Cribbs from Bellingham, Washington, told the
rally.
