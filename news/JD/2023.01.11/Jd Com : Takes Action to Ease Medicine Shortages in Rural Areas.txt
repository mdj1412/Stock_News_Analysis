      After it was announced that there was an urgent need for transportation of medical supplies, JD Logistics exerted its supply chain advantages immediately, dispatched human and transportation resources on call, and delivered the medical supplies to rural areas. The 30,000 sets of oximeters will be distributed to 86 counties in Gansu province.
    

      JD Logistics has activated a prioritized mechanism for the delivery of medical products, and extended the working hours for last-mile delivery to enable smooth rural logistics and distribution.
    

      JD Health is also dedicated to ease the medicine shortages in rural areas with its own specialty offerings. The "JD Health Emergency Medicine Box" public welfare project has been launched recently, as a joint initiative of JD Health and China Social Assistance Foundation to support rural areas. With the support of 1,810 merchants on JD Health, the first batch antipyretic medicine will be donated to 37,000 rural people in Henan, Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi and Guangxi provinces.
