It took everyone by surprise: Employers added 517,000 jobs in January, up from 260,000 in December. This is way higher than the 188,000 expected in a Bloomberg consensus. The unemployment rate is down to 3.4 percent, the lowest since 1969.
This data shows that the Fed's task isn't done and that efforts to cool the labor market to tame inflation have not been working as well as hoped. This comes on the heel of poor results from U.S. tech stocks. Will this be dampening investor optimism? As I write these lines, futures on the Nasdaq are down 2.2%.

Until now, investors thought the direction of U.S. monetary policy had taken a sufficiently positive turn and that other concerns were secondary. The rotation to riskier bets became the dominant bet. Goodbye Healthcare, Oil, Defense and hello Real Estate, Technology and Consumer Discretionary.
Let's talk about complacency, without denying our pleasure to see a nice recovery across equity markets in the past few sessions. Complacency is what creates asset bubbles. It is a mixture FOMO, following the crowd and intellectual laziness. It comes back as soon as the appetite for risk grows and it is what contributes to create the imbalances that will cause the next bear markets. The speed at which markets have been returning to speculative territory lately is astounding. At the close yesterday, the Nasdaq 100 had rallied 22.6% from its October low, which means that it meets the technical definition of a "bull market," an event that while not rare is not that common. The technology index is up 17% since January 1, after jumping another 3.5% yesterday. In Europe, the same pattern can be seen with major indices up sharply: 2.1% for the DAX and 1.3% for the CAC40 for example.
The very principle of the recovery makes sense given the scenario that is taking shape, but its magnitude raises questions. In the minds of investors, the main hurdle facing the market recovery was the US central bank and its restrictive monetary policy. The underlying macroeconomic environment was a distant second. Let's talk about both.
The Fed on Wednesday gave the impression that it had missed its communication exercise. When it said gray, the market heard white. And when it said black, the market didn't listen at all. Investors are forgetting about the famous adage "Don't Fight the Fed," which means that betting against U.S. monetary policy is a doomed enterprise. They believe that the end of rate hikes is imminent - although the latest employment figures might give them food for thought - and they seem confident that rates will not remain high in the medium term.
It is on the second point, the macroeconomic context, that there should be more debate in the weeks to come. Overnight, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet all reported results below expectations. All three stocks have dropped. The turmoil in the quarterly performance of the tech stars - Meta being the exception - is a sign that the conveyor belt of the Fed's restrictive monetary policy has begun to take its toll on the economy, even on those parts deemed to be the most protected. This makes sense, but it will lead analysts, who are generally slow to revise their expectations, to correct their course this quarterly season. This is a point of vigilance, even if the driving force in the weeks to come clearly remains the dynamics of monetary policy.
In other news, the recovery of the Chinese economy was confirmed by the publication of a Caixin services PMI indicator back in the expansion zone, with stronger momentum than economists had expected. It is impossible to ignore the debacle of the Adani empire on the Bombay stock exchange, with the share price of the leading holding company Adani Enterprises collapsing by more than 25% today. This crisis is causing a stir even in the Indian parliament and casting a pall of suspicion over other leading companies in the country. The plunge was triggered by the publication on January 24 of a damning report by short-seller Hindenburg Research.
Let's end with a little heads-up: My colleague Greg Legrand will take over this column for the next two week, as I'm going on a well-deserved vacation… Do not worry, I'm leaving you in good hands!
 
Economic highlights of the day:
The second reading of the services PMI indices of the major economies in January and US employment figures for January are today's main indicators, as well as the ISM services index. All the agenda is here. Overnight, China's Caixin services PMI for January rose to 52.9 points, much higher than expected.
The dollar gained 0.6% against the euro to EUR 0.9233 and gained 0.9% against the pound to GBP 0.8259. The ounce of gold fell to USD 1884. Oil remains under pressure, with North Sea Brent at USD 82.18 a barrel and U.S. light crude WTI at USD 75.86. The yield on 10-year US debt is still falling at 3.37%. Bitcoin is back up around USD 23,500.
