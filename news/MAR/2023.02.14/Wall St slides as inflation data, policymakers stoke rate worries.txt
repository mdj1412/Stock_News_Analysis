Tuesday after data showed consumer prices accelerated in
January, while hawkish remarks from Federal Reserve officials
cemented fears that the central bank will continue raising
interest rates this year.Data showed U.S. consumer prices accelerated in January as
Americans continued to be burdened by higher costs for rental
housing, suggesting that the Fed was far from pausing its rate
increase campaign.The consumer price index increased 0.5% last month after
gaining 0.1% in December, the Labor Department said. In the 12
months through January, the CPI increased 6.4%, more than the
6.2% forecast by economists."The number would lead me to believe that they (Fed
officials) are not going to change what they have said, which is
there's more work to be done and I think that's true," Andrew
Slimmon, managing director at Morgan Stanley Investment said.Money market traders are betting on at least two more 25
basis point rate hikes this year, with interest rates seen
peaking at 5.28% by July.Further adding to the investor angst were hawkish
remarks by Richmond Fed PresidentThomas Barkinand Dallas Fed PresidentLorie Logan, with Barkin stating that the Fed needs to prioritize
quashing inflation over risks to U.S. economic growth.Wall Street has had an upbeat start to the year, driven by a
renewed interest in growth stocks that were battered in 2022 as
the Fed raised rates aggressively to bring steep prices under
control.The rally, however, stalled last week following signs of a
tight labor market and hawkish commentary from Fed policymakers.Investors will closely watch January retail sales data on
Wednesday for hints on consumer spending amid worries of an
economic slowdown.At 12:10 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average

estimates as it benefited from strong travel demand.Palantir Technologies soared 13.1% after the data
analytics firm forecast its first profitable year.Nearly 69% of more than half of the S&P 500 firms that have
reported results have beaten profit expectations, as per

earnings to fall 2.8% from a year earlier.Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.14-to-1
