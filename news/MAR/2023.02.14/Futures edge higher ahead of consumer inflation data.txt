The Labor Department report, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show consumer prices climbed 0.5% in January, on a month-over-month basis following a 0.1% rise in December. However, on a year-on-year basis inflation is expected to have eased to 6.2% last month from a 6.5% rise in December.Markets have had an upbeat start to this year, driven by a renewed interest in growth stocks that were left battered in 2022 as the Fed worked to bring steep prices under control.However, the rally has stalled recently as signs of a still-tight labor market and hawkish commentary from Federal Reserve policymakers gave way to expectations of the U.S. central bank staying hawkish throughout the year.A Reuters poll showed that a majority of economists see two more rate hikes in March and May with no cuts by year-end, bringing the majority of private-sector forecasters in line with the central bank's own projections and rhetoric.Money market traders have priced in at least two more 25 basis point rate hikes this year and see interest rates peaking at 5.18% by July.
