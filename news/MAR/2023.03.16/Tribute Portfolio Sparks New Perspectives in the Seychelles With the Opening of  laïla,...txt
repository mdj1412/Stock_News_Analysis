Tribute Portfolio -- part of Marriott Bonvoy's growing collection of characterful, independent hotels, welcomes its latest addition in Europe, the Middle East and Africa with the opening of Iaïla, Seychelles, a Tribute Portfolio Resort (https://apo-opa.info/42kBiyT). Marking the brand's debut in the Seychelles, the resort offers an oasis perfect for island exploration and revitalisation set in the serenity of a natural botanical paradise. Located close to Anse Royal, the photo-ready white sandy beach on the Southeastern coast of Mahé, the Seychelles' largest island, the resort is set to showcase the hidden gems of the island for travellers and locals who seek out independent experiences and crave a connection with the community when traveling."We are thrilled to be opening Iaïla, Seychelles, a Tribute Portfolio Resort and to introduce the brand to this vibrant, leisure destination," said Sandra Schulze-Potgieter, Vice President, Premium & Select Brands, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Marriott International, "As the first Tribute Portfolio property in the Seychelles and further growing its footprint in EMEA, this resort advocates the brand's passion for captivating design and sincere service, while offering unique experiences that connect guests to the spirit of the destination."Designed by MMAC Design, the resort has a harmoniously calming colour palette complemented by bold pops of green which pay homage to the beautiful tropical surroundings. With carefully curated interiors, guests will appreciate the intricate detailing throughout, including the lobby ceiling which has been carved to reflect the shapes of the many islands in the Seychelles. Each of the resort's 76 bespoke guest rooms is decorated with nature-inspired aesthetics, featuring a mural of the Seychelles' plant silhouette, hand woven macramé bed board, and room separator made with wood and rattan, the natural materials often used in the island's traditional architecture. In addition, families or a collective of friends can choose from the resort's eight boutique suites, including the Senior Suite with a private plunge pool and terrace overlooking the Indian Ocean and surrounding mountains.The resort features no shortage of distinct amenities, including a water sports centre, outdoor swimming pool, 24/7 gym, spa, barbershop, and kids' recreation area. Tailor-made for guests who want to be part of something and seek out experiences that draw them into a larger community, the resort's expansive activity offerings draw on the Seychellois spirit to captivate minds. Guests can take part in thoughtfully curated village experiences including Creole cooking classes, traditional weaving demonstrations, and evenings dancing around the bonfire to the traditional and charming sounds of Moutya music. Guests looking to live like a local can join insiders on day trips to explore the village market, embark on a fishing trip, hike through the jungle, or take expeditions to neighbouring islands arranged by native experts. Additionally, guests can enjoy sunrise yoga, jogging along the resort's tropical trails, jewellery making using foraged shells, or opt for water sports including paddle boarding, kayaking, and snorkelling at the famous uninhabited 'Ile Souris' coral island, which is frequented by an array of coral fish and sea turtles.After a day of inspiring adventures, guests can relax at the Iaïla Spa with expert therapists who offer a full range of facial and body treatments, which include healing practices using only organic and handmade products made with local ingredients, such as coconut, vanilla, and cinnamon.A foodies' haven, the resort features five restaurants and bars, designed to capture the spirit of the community and attract guests and locals alike. Laroul offers an international array of cuisines and cultures with a distinctive Seychellois touch throughout the breakfast and dinner services. Signature dishes feature daily catches from the Indian Ocean and seasonal produce, such as Grilled Red Snapper and Flambé with Star Fruit. Kafe Kreol Beachside Bar and Restaurant is designed with a rustic concept and décor, serving up authentic Creole and Italian cuisine paired with both classic and locally inspired cocktails made with Takamaka Bay rum and fresh local produce such as coconuts and tamarind.
