T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMUS) (“T-Mobile”) announced today the expiration, on March 17, 2023, and results of the consent solicitations by its wholly-owned subsidiaries Sprint LLC (“Sprint”) (the “Sprint Consent Solicitation”) and Sprint Capital Corporation (“SCC”) (the “SCC Consent Solicitation,” and together with the Sprint Consent Solicitation, the “Consent Solicitations”). Sprint received the consents necessary to effect certain amendments to the senior notes indenture, dated as of September 11, 2013 (as supplemented and amended, the “Sprint Indenture”), governing Sprint’s 7.875% Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”), 7.125% Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”), 7.625% Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) and 7.625% Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes,” and together with the 2023 Notes, the 2024 Notes and the 2025 Notes, the “Sprint Notes”). SCC received the consents necessary to effect certain amendments to the indenture, dated as of October 1, 1998 (as supplemented and amended, the “SCC Indenture”), governing SCC’s 6.875% Notes due 2028 (the “2028 Notes”) and 8.750% Notes due 2032 (the “2032 Notes,” and together with the 2028 Notes, the “SCC Notes,” and together with the Sprint Notes, the “Notes”).

The Consent Solicitations were conducted in connection with the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, dated as of September 6, 2022 (as it may be amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the “Purchase Agreement”), made by and among Sprint, Sprint Communications LLC (“Sprint Communications”) and Cogent Infrastructure, Inc. (“Cogent”), pursuant to which Cogent agreed to acquire certain assets and liabilities primarily relating to the U.S. long-haul fiber network (including the non-U.S. extensions thereof) of Sprint Communications and its subsidiaries (such assets and liabilities collectively, the “Wireline Business”) on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement provides that, upon the terms and conditions set forth therein, Sprint Communications will undertake a divisive merger and Cogent will purchase from Sprint all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of a newly formed Delaware limited liability company resulting from such divisive merger that holds the Wireline Business (the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, the “Wireline Transaction”).

Sprint Consent Solicitation

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions described in Sprint’s Consent Solicitation Statement, dated March 13, 2023 (the “Sprint Solicitation Statement”), Sprint solicited consents from registered holders of the Sprint Notes to expressly provide that the restriction on mergers, consolidations and transfers of all or substantially all property and assets of Sprint Communications shall not apply to the Wireline Transaction or certain divisive mergers in connection with or in contemplation of a disposition or other separation of the Wireline Business (such amendments, the “Sprint Amendments”).

In conjunction with receiving the requisite consents, on March 17, 2023, Sprint and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Sprint Trustee”), executed and delivered the ninth supplemental indenture (the “Ninth Supplemental Indenture”) to the Sprint Indenture (such time, the “Sprint Effective Time”), pursuant to which, with respect to each series of Sprint Notes, the Sprint Amendments will become operative upon the payment of the Consent Payments (as defined in the Sprint Solicitation Statement) in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Sprint Solicitation Statement. Except for the Sprint Amendments, all of the existing terms of the Sprint Notes and the Sprint Indenture will remain unchanged.

Sprint will pay to D.F. King & Co., Inc. (the “Tabulation and Payment Agent”) a cash payment of $1.00 per $1,000 in principal amount of Sprint Notes set forth in the table below for the benefit of the holders of each series of Sprint Notes whose consents were validly delivered (and not revoked) at or prior to the expiration of the Sprint Consent Solicitation, upon the terms and subject to the conditions described in the Sprint Solicitation Statement.
