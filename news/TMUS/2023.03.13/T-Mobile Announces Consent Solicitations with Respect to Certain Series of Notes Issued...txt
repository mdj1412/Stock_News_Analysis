T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMUS) (“T-Mobile”) announced today that its wholly-owned subsidiaries Sprint LLC (“Sprint”) and Sprint Capital Corporation (“SCC”) have each commenced a consent solicitation (the “Sprint Consent Solicitation” and the “SCC Consent Solicitation”, respectively, and together, the “Consent Solicitations”).

The Sprint Consent Solicitation relates to proposed amendments to the senior notes indenture, dated as of September 11, 2013 (as supplemented and amended, the “Sprint Indenture”), governing Sprint’s 7.875% Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”), 7.125% Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”), 7.625% Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) and 7.625% Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes,” and together with the 2023 Notes, the 2024 Notes and the 2025 Notes, the “Sprint Notes”).

The SCC Consent Solicitation relates to proposed amendments to the indenture, dated as of October 1, 1998 (as supplemented and amended, the “SCC Indenture”), governing SCC’s 6.875% Notes due 2028 (the “2028 Notes”) and 8.750% Notes due 2032 (the “2032 Notes,” and together with the 2028 Notes, the “SCC Notes,” and together with the Sprint Notes, the “Notes”).

The Consent Solicitations are being conducted in connection with the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, dated as of September 6, 2022 (as it may be amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the “Purchase Agreement”), made by and among Sprint, Sprint Communications LLC (“Sprint Communications”) and Cogent Infrastructure, Inc. (“Cogent”), pursuant to which Cogent agreed to acquire certain assets and liabilities primarily relating to the U.S. long-haul fiber network (including the non-U.S. extensions thereof) of Sprint Communications and its subsidiaries (such assets and liabilities collectively, the “Wireline Business”) on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement provides that, upon the terms and conditions set forth therein, Sprint Communications will undertake a divisive merger and Cogent will purchase from Sprint all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of a newly formed Delaware limited liability company resulting from such divisive merger that holds the Wireline Business (the contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, the “Wireline Transaction”).

Sprint Consent Solicitation

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions described in the Sprint Solicitation Statement (as defined below), Sprint is soliciting consents from registered holders of the Sprint Notes to expressly provide that the restriction on mergers, consolidations and transfers of all or substantially all property and assets of Sprint Communications shall not apply to the Wireline Transaction or certain divisive mergers in connection with or in contemplation of a disposition or other separation of the Wireline Business (such amendments, the “Sprint Proposed Amendments”).

Following the Sprint Proposed Amendments, the Sprint Notes will continue to be guaranteed by Sprint Communications, as well as by T-Mobile and T-Mobile USA, Inc. (“T-Mobile USA”), the parent companies of Sprint.

Sprint is offering to pay each holder who validly delivers and does not validly revoke its consent to the Sprint Proposed Amendments in the manner described in the Sprint Solicitation Statement on or prior to the Expiration Time (as defined below) a cash payment to the Tabulation and Payment Agent of $1.00 per $1,000 principal amount of Sprint Notes set forth in the table below with respect to which consents have been validly delivered (the “Sprint Consent Payments”) for the benefit of the applicable holders, subject to satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of certain conditions, including the receipt of valid consents of a majority in aggregate principal amount of each series of Sprint Notes (the “Sprint Requisite Consents”) and receipt of the SCC Requisite Consents (as defined under “SCC Consent Solicitation”) in the SCC Consent Solicitation. The consummation of the Sprint Consent Solicitation and the payment of Sprint Consent Payments are conditioned upon the receipt of the Sprint Requisite Consents and SCC Requisite Consents; however, Sprint may waive such condition and choose to accept consents with respect to any particular series of Sprint Notes.
