            OUR APPROACH
          

            NET-ZERO BY2040
          



            We're a company inspired to change the world for the better.
          

            T-Mobile's mission is to be the best in the world at connecting customers to their world. It is at the heart of who we are, driving our obsession to enable more people in more places to have access to the connectivity shaping virtually all aspects of modern life.
          

            Recent years have served as powerful reminders of the increasingly critical role digital connectivity plays in our daily lives-from accessing education, healthcare, jobs, and social services, to staying in contact with loved ones and the world around us. To help create a connected world where everyone can thrive, we are committed
          

            to investing in initiatives that make our business more resilient and our products and services more sustainable.
          

            We know climate action is important to our customers and other stakeholders, which is why we are investing in connectivity solutions that put our company, and our industry, on a path to a more sustainable future. We want the products and services that enable our customers to stay digitally connected to also have a positive impact on the world we all share.
          

            That's why we are proud to be the first in U.S. wireless to set a science-basednet-zero target validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) using their Net-Zero Standard.
          

            Our net-zero commitment builds on the real, measurable progress we've made over the past several years. In January 2022, we announced1 we were the first U.S. wireless
          



            provider to source 100% of our total electricity usage with renewable energy2. But that's not all: we also achieved our original science-based targets3 four years ahead of schedule and are making meaningful progress in our work to reduce waste and responsibly manage the lifecycle of our products.
          

            T-Mobile is rising to the challenge.
          

            By making meaningful changes to how we operate and harnessing the power of our 5G technology solutions, we can play a role in the global transition to a net-zero economy.
          

            This report details our pathway to net-zero and how, through the relentless pursuit of progress, T-Mobile can contribute to this global effort and help secure a thriving, sustainable future for all.
          

            A recent study4 showed that 5G-enabled technologies could help facilitate up
          

            to one-fifth of the reductions required under the U.S. climate change target by
          

            2025. Not only can the power of 5G help companies grow their businesses, but it can also provide significant downstream carbon abatement potential. We can expect to see sustainable transformations fueled by 5G in industries such as manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, smart cities, and more.

            Our Goals and Progress
          




                  A Science-Based Approach to Net-Zero Emissions
                





                  We believe in taking a science-based approach to
                






            NET-ZERO GOAL
          

            ACHIEVE NET-ZERO FOR SCOPE 1+2+3 GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS BY 2040 (FROM 20205)

                  Net-zero
                







          The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)
        







                  tackling the climate crisis. That's why we've aligned
                





                  our 2040 net-zero goal with SBTi's Net-Zero Standard.
                





                  This helps us set targets aligned to a robust, universal
                





                  set of criteria and align our actions with global efforts
                





                  to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C. It also means
                





                  that there is an independent assessment of our
                





                  ambition level and progress over time.
                




            As part of our net-zero goal, we have two science-based targets to guide our near-term and long-term emission reduction actions. T-Mobile's goal is to abate―or reduce―our emissions to be as close to zero as possible. Coupled with our long-term target of a 90% reduction in total emissions by 2040, carbon offsets may be needed to address the remaining 10% or less of emissions to help us reach net-zero.
          



            NEAR-TERM TARGET
          

            Reduce absolute Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions 55% by 2030.
          

            ENERGY GOALS
          

            ENERGY EFFICIENCY GOAL
          

            Achieve a 95% reduction in energy consumption (MWh) per petabyte (PB) of data traffic on T-Mobile's network by 20306.
          

            15.2%
          

            The amount of energy we use is directly tied to our carbon footprint, which is why we've set an energy efficiency goal. Achieving this goal will mean that, across our business, we'll use 20 times less total energy each time a customer uses our network to search the Internet or stream a song. This is particularly important as we anticipate data consumption to increase in the coming years, which has a direct impact on the energy demand required to run our network.
          



            LONG-TERM TARGET
          

            Reach net-zero GHG emissions across Scope 1, 2, and 3 by 2040. As part of this commitment, T-Mobile aims to reduce absolute emissions by 90% by 2040.
          

            RENEWABLE ENERGY GOAL
          

            Source renewable energy equivalent to 100% of total electricity usage by 2021.
          

            100%
          

            A critical part of our emissions is linked to purchased energy. T-Mobile joined RE100 in 2018 and pledged to power our business with 100% renewable electricity. Now that we've met this goal, we plan to continue sourcing renewable energy to meet our electricity needs so that we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and keep the emissions from our operational footprint low.
          



            The SBTi is a joint effort between the Climate Disclosure Project, UN Global Compact, World Wildlife Fund, and World Resources Institute that enables businesses to take climate action by setting ambitious and meaningful emissions reduction targets.
          

            The SBTi helps companies align with the Paris Agreement, which determined that to reduce catastrophic climate change, we must keep the global temperature increase below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C.
          

            In 2021, SBTi launched the new Net-Zero Standard which provides a clear, science- based definition of net-zero, creating a widely accepted blueprint for companies to establish net-zero goals.
          

            The Net-Zero Standard requires deep decarbonization of at least 90% to reach net-zero, and neutralization of any residual emissions that are not possible to eliminate.
          





Per the SBTi Target Validation Protocol, T-Mobile's 2020 base year emissions of 8,372,354 MT CO2e exclude indirect use-phase emissions from sold contracts.
          

From a 2019 baseline year.

            Our Path to Zero
          

            As we embark on our journey to net-zero by 2040, we are committed to continuously evaluating our pathway and adapting it to an evolving operating environment. This includes incorporating new innovations and emerging trends into our strategy as our business grows and the global landscape evolves.
          

            Environmental sustainability is an intentional part of our business strategy and a cornerstone of our aim
          

            to operate responsibly. A key part of our overall climate strategy is to separate emissions from our business growth. As both our customer base and our network footprint grow, our energy and climate goals help us to continue to minimize our energy consumption and our overall carbon footprint.
          

            T-Mobile has led the wireless industry with our commitment to sustainably managing
          

            our environmental footprint, and now we're continuing to raise the bar with this ambitious net-zero emissions goal. Big, bold programs like this will not only have tremendously important positive outcomes on climate-they are also good business. Year after year our investor community is increasingly interested in our environmental and social commitments and progress because they recognize that this work is both meaningful to consumers and benefits the long-term operations of the company."
