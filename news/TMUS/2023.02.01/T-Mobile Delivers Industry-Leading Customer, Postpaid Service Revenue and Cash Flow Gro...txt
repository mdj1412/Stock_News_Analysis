Industry-Leading and Record High Postpaid and Broadband Customer Growth in 2022

Differentiated Growth Model Unlocks Strong Financial Results and Accelerates Shareholder Returns in 2022

Independent Third Party Experts Crown T-Mobile the New Overall Network Leader While Extending 5G Lead

Doing Good — The Un-carrier Way — Ranked Top 20 on America’s Most JUST Companies in 2023

Strong 2023 Outlook Driven by Continued Profitable Customer Growth and Merger Synergies

T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMUS) reported fourth quarter and full-year 2022 results today, delivering industry-leading postpaid service revenue and cash flow growth in 2022, enabling the Un-carrier to begin shareholder returns earlier than planned. T-Mobile further extended its fame for value while translating its 5G lead into overall network leadership for the first time, resulting in the company’s lowest ever annual postpaid phone churn along with industry-best and record high postpaid account, postpaid customer and broadband customer growth in 2022.

“With record postpaid account and customer net adds that translated into industry-leading postpaid service revenue and cash flow growth, T-Mobile absolutely smashed 2022 by once again focusing on putting customers first,” said Mike Sievert, CEO of T-Mobile. “In true Un-carrier fashion, we have no plans to slow down in 2023. Now that we are being recognized as not only the 5G leader but the clear overall network leader in the U.S., our differentiated and sustainable growth strategy is opening up even bigger pathways for our future!”

Independent Third Party Experts Crown T-Mobile the New Overall Network Leader While Extending 5G Lead

T-Mobile is the leader in 5G with the country’s largest, fastest, most reliable and most awarded 5G network. The company’s 5G network covers 325 million people (98% of Americans), and its super-fast Ultra Capacity 5G covers 265 million people nationwide. Approximately 60% of T-Mobile’s postpaid customers have a 5G phone and approximately two-thirds of all traffic is on 5G.

Furthermore, the Un-carrier’s 5G network leadership is translating into overall network leadership as noted by multiple third parties. For the first time, T-Mobile takes the crown as the overall network leader in America:

Accelerated Integration Progress Positions T-Mobile to Approach Full Run-Rate Merger Synergies in 2023

T-Mobile achieved a huge milestone by substantially completing the network decommissioning in Q3 2022, less than 2.5 years post-merger closing, and more than a year ahead of the original merger plan. The company expects to substantially complete its integration by the end of 2023.

T-Mobile realized approximately $6.0 billion in Merger synergies in 2022, with $2.5 billion of selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense reductions and $2.2 billion of cost of services expense reductions, which increased cash flows while funding growth initiatives and network build, and $1.3 billion in avoided network build costs.

The company incurred Merger-related costs of $592 million in Q4 2022 and $5.0 billion in 2022. Net of taxes, Merger-related costs were $444 million, or $0.36 per share, in Q4 2022 and $3.7 billion, or $2.97 per share, in 2022. Cash payments for merger-related costs were $622 million in Q4 2022 and $3.4 billion in 2022.

Doing Good — The Un-carrier Way — Industry Leader in Building a More Connected and Sustainable Future

T-Mobile continues to stay true to its commitment to use its network, scale and resources for good, building a more connected, equitable and sustainable future:

T-Mobile is not able to forecast Net income on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting certain items that affect GAAP Net income, including, but not limited to, Income tax expense and Interest expense. Core Adjusted EBITDA should not be used to predict Net income as the difference between this measure and Net income is variable.

(2)

Management uses Core Adjusted EBITDA as a measure to monitor the financial performance of company operations, excluding the impact of lease revenues from related device financing programs. Guidance ranges assume lease revenues of approximately $300 million for 2023.

(3)

Merger-related costs are excluded from Core Adjusted EBITDA but will impact Net income, Net cash provided by operating activities and Free Cash Flow.

(4)

Capital expenditures means cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest.

(5)

Free Cash Flow guidance does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization in 2023.

Stock-based compensation includes payroll tax impacts and may not agree to stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, certain stock-based compensation expenses associated with the Sprint merger have been included in Merger-related costs.

(2)

Legal-related expenses (recoveries), net, consists of the settlement of certain litigation associated with the August 2021 cyberattack, net of insurance recoveries.

(3)

Other, net, primarily consists of certain severance, restructuring and other expenses and income, including gains from the sale of IP addresses, not directly attributable to the Merger which are not reflective of T-Mobile’s core business activities (“special items”), and are, therefore, excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA.

Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before Interest expense, net of Interest income, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and certain income and expenses not reflective of T-Mobile’s ongoing operating performance. Core Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA less lease revenues. Core Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by T-Mobile’s management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. T-Mobile uses Core Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as benchmarks to evaluate T-Mobile’s operating performance in comparison to its competitors. T-Mobile also uses Core Adjusted EBITDA internally as a measure to evaluate and compensate its personnel and management for their performance. Management believes analysts and investors use Core Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures to evaluate overall operating performance and to facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications companies because they are indicative of T-Mobile’s ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of Interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, stock-based compensation, Merger-related costs, including network decommissioning costs, impairment expense, losses on disposal groups held for sale and certain legal-related recoveries and expenses, as well as other special income and expenses which are not reflective of T-Mobile’s core business activities. Management believes analysts and investors use Core Adjusted EBITDA because it normalizes for the transition in the company’s device financing strategy, by excluding the impact of lease revenues from Adjusted EBITDA, to align with the related depreciation expense on leased devices, which is excluded from the definition of Adjusted EBITDA. Core Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for Net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).
