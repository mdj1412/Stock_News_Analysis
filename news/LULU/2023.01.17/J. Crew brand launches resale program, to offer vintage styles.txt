Jan 17 (Reuters) - J. Crew Group said on Tuesday it had
launched a new resale program for its eponymous brand, which
will offer used styles online and vintage apparel in select J.
Crew stores.Under the company's new "J. Crew Always" banner, pre-owned
styles will be listed through its website and through ThredUp
, an online consignment platform which partners with the
clothing retailer on resale services.Liz Hershfield, senior vice president & head of
sustainability for J. Crew Group, announced the program at the
National Retail Federation's Big Show in New York.Customers can also send gently worn J. Crew items to ThredUp
in exchange for shopping credit.As part of the program, some of the brand's vintage
styles from the 1980s and '90s will also be available
exclusively in the company's Bowery and Fifth Avenue stores in
New York, Hershfield said.J. Crew Group has been growing its resale business over the
last two years. The company partnered with ThredUp in 2021 to
sell pre-owned clothing from its brand, Madewell, which allowed
customers to trade in old products for store credit."Resale is still quite small for us, but ultimately the goal
is to grow a circular business where you can extend the life of
a product and it's profitable and it does really well,"
Hershfield said at the event.Brian Ehrig, a partner at global consulting firm
Kearney, said there was no universal consensus among analysts
over how large the resale market could grow.But brokerage Morningstar has estimated it could expand
to $300 billion by 2031, according to Ehrig, who spoke on the
same panel as Hershfield.J. Crew Group is part of a growing list of retailers,
including IKEA and Lululemon Athletica Inc, to add
resale programs over the last several years.
