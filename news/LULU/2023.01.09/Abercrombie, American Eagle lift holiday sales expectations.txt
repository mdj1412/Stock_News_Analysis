Jan 9 (Reuters) - Abercrombie & Fitch Co and
American Eagle Outfitters Inc raised their sales
forecasts for the holiday quarter on Monday as consumers snapped
up their winter wear during the peak shopping season.Shares of Abercrombie, which owns the Hollister label,
jumped more than 11% in afternoon trade, while American Eagle
climbed about 2%.The apparel chains have been revamping their inventories to
get rid of outdated styles, with Abercrombie replacing casual
wear and athleisure clothing with new styles that have drawn
more shoppers to its stores.Abercrombie's 2022 holiday assortment was a "marked
improvement on the selection being offered earlier in the year,"
said GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders, noting that
seasonal staples such as flannel shirts, pajamas, and outerwear
performed very well.Ohio-based Abercrombie said it now expects net sales to rise
between 1% and 2% in the holiday quarter, compared with its
prior forecast for a 2% to 4% fall.It projected fourth-quarter operating margin between 6% and
8%, up from a range of 5% to 7% estimated previously.The company said overall sales had improved from the third
quarter, but its Hollister brand's performance was still
expected to lag 2021 levels in the holiday quarter.American Eagle also said its fourth-quarter revenue and
profit margins were tracking at the high end of its forecasts,
benefiting from its decision to right-size inventory and a
better-than-expected performance at its American Eagle label.Meanwhile, yoga wear maker Lululemon Athletica Inc
lowered its expectations for fourth-quarter gross margins,
sending its shares down about 8% on Monday. Last week,
department store chain Macy's Inc projected
holiday-quarter sales toward the lower end of its previous
forecast.
