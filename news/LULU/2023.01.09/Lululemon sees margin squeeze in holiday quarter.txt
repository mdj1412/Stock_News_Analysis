The "athleisure" chain is grappling with increased costs amid a drop in consumer spending due to stubbornly high inflation.       A sharp rise in inventory levels has forced several retailers to offer discounts and mark down prices.     That's put a dent in margins across the apparel sector.      Inventories at lululemon rose 85% at the end of the third quarter to $1.7 billion.     Despite the holiday woes, the company did raise its net revenue forecast for the fourth quarter and expects revenue growth of 25% or more, year over year, to as much as $2.7 billion.     In contrast, apparel retailers Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle Outfitters issued upbeat holiday-quarter expectations on Monday, benefiting from strong demand across their brands.
