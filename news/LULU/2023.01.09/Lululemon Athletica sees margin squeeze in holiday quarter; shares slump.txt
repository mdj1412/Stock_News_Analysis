Jan 9 (Reuters) - Lululemon Athletica Inc
forecast a decline in holiday-quarter gross margins on Monday as
the apparel maker discounts more and grapples with higher costs,
sending its shares down more than 9%.Stubbornly high inflation and the threat of a recession in
the United States have resulted in a shift in consumer spending
away from discretionary products, forcing deeper discounts from
apparel and sportswear companies to attract cash-strapped
consumers.High-end clothing companies such as Lululemon had fared
relatively well for much of last year, but an 85% jump in the
company's inventory levels at the end of the third quarter
showed that even affluent shoppers were pulling back on
spending."Looking ahead we see dark clouds forming with difficult
compares, peak margins, high inventory, and rising competition,"
said Jefferies analyst Randal Konik, adding that the need for
more discounts to get rid of excess stocks is likely to weigh on
margins going forward.Lululemon said it expects gross margin to decline 90-110
basis points in the fourth quarter, compared with its previous
expectation of an increase of 10-20 basis points.The company, however, raised its fourth-quarter net revenue
forecast to between $2.66 billion and $2.70 billion, from its
previous range of $2.61 billion to $2.66 billion.It also tightened its outlook for fourth-quarter earnings
per share to between $4.22 and $4.27, compared with its prior
forecast of $4.20 to $4.30.Department store chain Macy's Inc said on Monday it
saw weakness in its sportswear and casual apparel business after
the company on Friday projected fourth-quarter sales to come in
at the lower end of its forecast.However, apparel retailers Abercrombie & Fitch Co
and American Eagle Outfitters Inc issued upbeat
holiday-quarter expectations on Monday, benefiting from strong
demand across their brands.
