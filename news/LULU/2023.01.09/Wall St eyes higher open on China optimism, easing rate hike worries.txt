open higher on Monday on optimism around China reopening its
borders, while signs of a cooling labor market boosted bets of a
slower pace of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.After being clobbered in 2022 by rapid rate hikes, the
benchmark S&P 500 and Nasdaq snapped a four-week
decline on Friday after a moderation in wage increases and a
decline in U.S. services activity in December buoyed hopes of a
less hawkish stance from the Fed."The number of jobs created is working its way down slowly
and wages are starting to calm down. Both of those are important
for inflation coming under control, without necessarily
careening the U.S economy to a recession," said Art Hogan, chief
market strategist at B. Riley Financial.The highly awaited U.S. Labor Department's inflation report
on Thursday is expected to show some moderation in year-on-year
consumer prices in December.Money market bets show 75% odds of a 25-basis point hike in
the Fed's February policy meeting, with the terminal rate
expected just below 5% by June.Other economic data such as weekly jobless claims and the
University of Michigan's consumer sentiment report will also be
in focus this week, as big U.S. banks kick off the quarterly
earnings season on Friday.A slew of Fed officials including Chair Jerome Powell are
due to speak this week, with investors parsing their commentary
for more clues on the rate-hike trajectory.U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd
rose 5.0% in premarket trading on news that Ant Group's founder
Jack Ma will give up control of the Chinese fintech giant in an
overhaul.Shares of other Chinese firms such as Baidu Inc and
Pinduoduo Inc rose 1.5% and 2.9%, respectively, as a
full reopening of China's borders, since the start of the
pandemic, added to bets of a robust recovery in the world's
second-largest economy.At 8:00 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 103 points, or
0.30%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 16 points, or 0.41%, and
Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 56.75 points, or 0.51%.Tesla Inc climbed 3.3% as the electric-vehicle
maker indicated longer waiting times for potential buyers of
some versions of the Model Y in China, signaling that recently
announced price cuts could be stoking demand in the company's
second-largest market.Macy's Inc and Lululemon Athletica Inc
dropped 4.7% and 10%, respectively, following dour
holiday-quarter forecasts from both the retailers.
