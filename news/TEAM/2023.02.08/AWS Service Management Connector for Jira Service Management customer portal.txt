Starting today, customers can search, provision, terminate, update and use self-service actions on products from AWS Service Catalog through Atlassian's Jira Service Management Cloud customer portal via AWS Service Management Connector.This feature enables Jira Service Management end users who are registered users of the Atlassian site but are not Jira agents to provision resources using the AWS Service Catalog integration. With this connector, administrators can use existing AWS Service Catalog configurations, including curated products, portfolios, constraints, and tagging, and expose them to Jira Service Management Cloud administrators and users. Jira Service Management customers can browse and request provisioning of AWS Service Catalog products in their familiar IT Service Management (ITSM) tooling.In addition to the AWS Service Catalog integration, the connector also provides existing integrations with AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager and AWS Security Hub. These AWS CloudOps integrations help simplify cloud provisioning, operations and resource management as well as streamline Service Management governance and oversight over AWS services.The AWS Service Management Connector are available as plugins/apps to install at no-cost from the Atlassian Marketplace. Customers may incur cost for the AWS services used as well as the licensing for the ITSM tools. These new features are available in all AWS Regions where AWS Service Catalog, AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager and AWS Security Hub services are available.
