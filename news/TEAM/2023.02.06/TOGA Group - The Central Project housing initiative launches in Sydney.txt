TOGA Group, Atlassian and Dexus have joined forces with not-for-profit organisation My Foundations Youth Housing (MFYH) to launch The Central Project, providing those in need with temporary accommodation.The building known as The Central Project has been made available as an interim housing solution while Development Approval (DA) is being assessed for TOGA's development. Previously operating as the TFE Hotels' Adina Apartment Hotel Sydney Central, The Central Project has the capacity to house up to 50 people while they transition to more permanent accommodation.The Central Project is located next to Central Station and alongside Atlassian's new Sydney headquarters, Atlassian Central, currently under construction and the three buildings that will comprise Central Place Sydney. TOGA, Atlassian Central and Central Place Sydney will bookend the northern end of Sydney's new technology and innovation precinct.TOGA Group Managing Director, Allan Vidor, said this maximises a unique opportunity to collaborate with Atlassian, Dexus and MFYH to make the most of a fully equipped, apartment hotel that is available for affordable housing.Through this initiative we're able to provide 3-4 floors of secure and affordable apartments and make a real difference to the lives of young people and refugees. These homes will act as a much needed stop-gap while residents are finding their feet, helped by the team at MFYH and Settlement Services International, Mr Vidor said.Ric Wang, Global Head of Real Estate & Design, Atlassian said the company was proud of the partnership with TOGA Group and Dexus, and thrilled to be working with My Foundations Youth Housing.Since the early days of Atlassian, giving back has been part of our DNA. We see this as a unique opportunity to use an otherwise unoccupied property to make a difference for those in need, having people benefit from the space, Mr Wang said.Peter Morley, Dexus Project Director Atlassian Central, said the initiative was a product of strong collaboration and innovative thinking.Our partnership with Atlassian, My Foundations Youth Housing and TOGA Group to support at-risk youth and refugees in need of accommodation demonstrates the positive social impact organisations can have when they think outside the box, he said.Rebecca Mullins, CEO, MFYH, said the project showcases the impact of collaboration between corporate partners and charitable bodies.MFYH believes all young people should have a safe, supportive and affordable home, and this project offers accommodation smack bang in central Sydney for people in need, with transport connections and job opportunities on their doorstep, Ms Mullins said.MFYH has a history of partnering with TOGA Group, co-launching the Addison Project in 2014, which provided temporary accommodation to 850 young people over four years.The Central Project includes an anchoring retail space where Thread Together will open a shop to provide clothing for the occupants and others referred from social agencies.Anthony Chesler, CEO of Thread Together said the pop-up marketplace provided new clothing on a 'take what you need' basis. By collaborating with retailers and department stores they are able to provide brand-new clothing to thousands of individuals and families every week, and simultaneously save unsold clothing from being disposed of in landfill sites.Having access to the right clothing plays a critical role in helping restore dignity and empowering people to realise their full potential, and we are delighted to provide our services to a new cohort as part of this innovative project in central Sydney, Mr Chesler said.About TFE HotelsTFE Hotels (TOGA Far East Hotels) is Australia's International Hotel Group - headquartered in Sydney and operating in Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Denmark, Hungary, Austria, Singapore... and opening in Switzerland in 2023.
