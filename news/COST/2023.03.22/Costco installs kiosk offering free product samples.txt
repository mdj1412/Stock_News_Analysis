Costco Wholesale has introduced a self-serve kiosk offering free product samples. A photo of the kiosk posted on reddit from a Costco store at an undisclosed location showed a free-standing, modular kiosk bearing the letters, "Free Sample," and a smaller sign, "Take One" above a tray at the base of the kiosk.The Reddit post offered pictures of the products in the trays, most of which are packaged snacks, as well as some non-food items such as cleaning products.Nothing about the kiosk was posted on the Costco website, and a company spokesperson chose not to comment in response to a request from Kiosk Marketplace.The kiosk has drawn numerous comments on social media.Copyright Â© 2023 Networld Media.
