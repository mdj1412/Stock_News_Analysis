Feb 21 (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producer Diamondback Energy Inc
on Tuesday beat Wall Street expectations for fourth-quarter profit, as
tighter energy supplies following Russia's invasion of Ukraine boosted crude
prices.Crude prices retreated from their multi-year peak in the last quarter, but
remained 11% higher than a year earlier, primarily due to Western sanctions
imposed on major energy producer Russia, and OPEC+ curbing output which
tightened global supply.Midland, Texas-based Diamondback said total average unhedged realized prices
were at $55.76 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) in the reported quarter, 1.3%
lower from a year earlier.Its average production was 391,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day
(boepd), higher than 387,000 boepd last year.Adjusted net income stood at $5.29 per share, above analysts' average
estimate of $5.22 per share.For full-year 2023, Diamondback sees net production between 430,000 to
440,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), and $2.5 billion to $2.7
billion in capital expenditure.Diamondback in November said it would buy Lario Permian, a unit of Lario Oil
& Gas Company, for around $1.5 billion in cash and stock.Lario Permian's assets consist of about 25,000 acres in the Northern
Midland Basin in Texas, with estimated 2023 production of about 18,000 barrels
of oil per day.Peer Chesapeake Energy Corp also beat fourth-quarter profit
estimates on higher crude prices. It reported adjusted net income of $4.22 per
share, higher than average analysts' expectation of $2.99 per share.
