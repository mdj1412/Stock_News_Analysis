AMSTERDAM, March 9 (Reuters) - The Dutch government is
still working out important details of a plan to impose new
export restrictions on computer chip technology - including
which of the machines ASML Holding NV has already sold
to Chinese customers it will be allowed to maintain."Those details still need to be worked out," Trade Minister
Liesje Schreinemacher told reporters on Thursday in Stockholm.Schrienmacher's remarks highlight that, while a plan
announced by the Dutch on Wednesday puts the Netherlands in
broad alignment with U.S. goals of undermining China's ability
to make its own cutting edge chips, serious questions remain for
ASML and its Chinese customers.ASML has sold more than 8 billion euros ($8.46 billion)
worth of equipment in China since 2014.
