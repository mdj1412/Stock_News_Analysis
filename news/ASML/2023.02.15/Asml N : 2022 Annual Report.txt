          Smaller size, bigger capability is a well-established trend in the chip industry.
        

          And thanks to the joint efforts of our 39,000 people working together with suppliers,
        

          customers and innovation partners, we are taking that ever further.
        

          Every day we push the boundaries of physics and shrink patterns to help shape the
        

          future of life, work and play across the planet. Strongly embedded in a global
        

          innovation ecosystem, we enable ground-breaking technology that can help humanity manage challenges and seize opportunities by facilitating smart living and mobility, accessible healthcare, food security and the transition to renewable energy.
        

          Creating small patterns that enable a big impact.

          Record performance in a challenging year
        

          With record net bookings for 2022, an innovation pipeline filled with new products and services and our talented, energized and engaged people, we face the future with great confidence.
        




            Dear Stakeholder,
          

            The figures speak for themselves: record sales of â¬21.2 billion, up by 13.8% compared with 2021, a gross margin of 50.5% and a dividend per share of â¬5.80 add up to another outstanding year for ASML. Our net bookings stand at an unparalleled â¬30.7 billion for the year 2022, our pipeline is flowing freely, with a number of new products launched, set to launch or in development, and our people are talented, energized and engaged. Not surprisingly, we are looking forward to a very bright future with strong growth. I would like to thank all our stakeholders for their support during the year - and in particular I wish to pay tribute to our people, who have again displayed outstanding commitment and expertise, and without whom none of our achievements would have been possible.
          

            Yet despite the positive numbers, the reality is that 2022 could actually have been even better. Our ability to meet customer demand continued to be impacted by a set of circumstances that were not fully in our control. The aftermath of COVID-19, the ongoing war in Ukraine and struggles among
          



            Ultimately, we have seen the global chip shortage that first appeared in 2020 continue through 2022. We have all encountered this in one way or another in our personal lives, whether through delays in taking ownership of a new vehicle or reduced availability of technology such as solar panels.
          

            Delivering on our business strategyâ¦
          

            Although we have at times struggled operationally, from a strategic standpoint we have continued to deliver. Our comprehensive product portfolio is aligned to our customers' roadmaps, delivering cost- effective solutions in support of all applications, from leading-edge to mature nodes. Among many highlights of the year, we shipped the first TWINSCAN NXT:2100i, received new orders for the TWINSCAN EXE:5200 and saw several customers adopt Alignment Optimization 12 Color.
          



            While we had more unhappy customers than I would have liked, we have also experienced empathy and support. We have always kept customers fully informed of any delays to shipments, and they can see for themselves how our investments are set to increase capacity. Cranes stand across the skylines of our sites as our investment to increase our manufacturing capacity to 90 EUV 0.33 NA and 600 DUV systems by 2025-2026 begins to take shape, while we are also ramping our EUV 0.55 NA (High-NA) capacity to 20 systems by 2027-2028. And key partners such as Carl Zeiss are also busy adding capacity, doing everything they can to free the logjam in the supply chain.
          





            some of our supply chain partners to deliver according to our agreed plans due to material shortages have combined to cause significant turbulence and meant that we were unable to give our customers what they needed all of the time.
          



            Our investments are set to increase capacity."
          

            Peter Wennink
          

            President, Chief Executive Officer and Chair of the Board of Management
