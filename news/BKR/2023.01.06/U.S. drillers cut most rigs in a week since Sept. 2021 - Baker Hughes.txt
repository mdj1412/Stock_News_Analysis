Jan 6 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms this week cut seven
oil and natural gas rigs in their biggest weekly decline since
September 2021, energy services firm Baker Hughes Co
said in its closely followed report on Friday.The U.S. oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future
output, fell by seven to 772 in the week to Jan. 6, the lowest
since November. <RIG-USA-BHI> <RIG-OL-USA-BHI> <RIG-GS-USA-BHI>U.S. oil rigs fell three to 618 this week, their lowest
since November, while gas rigs dropped by four to 152, their
lowest since June.U.S. oil futures were down about 7% this week in
their worst start to the year since 2016. It had gained about 7%
in 2022.The shale oil patch closed the door ona disappointing yearwhile bracing for weaker output gains in 2023, hamstrung by
rising costs, dwindling reserves and pressures to hold down
spending.U.S. oil production last year was forecast to have risen
by an average of 620,000 barrels per day, according to the
latest government estimates, a third less than the roughly 1
million bpd some forecasts called for at the start of the year.
That shortfall has undercut shale's influence on global markets
and helped lift prices for the second year in a row.
