Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms cut the most oil
rigs in a week since September 2021, energy services firm Baker
Hughes Co said in its closely followed report on Friday.Oil rigs fell 10 to 613, their lowest since November, while
gas rigs rose six to 156, in their biggest weekly rise since
February.The combined oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of
future output, fell four to 771 in the week to Jan. 20, the
lowest since November. <RIG-USA-BHI> <RIG-OL-USA-BHI>
<RIG-GS-USA-BHI>Despite this week's rig decline, Baker Hughes said the total
count was still up 167, or 28%, over this time last year.U.S. oil futures were up about 1% so far this
year after gaining about 7% in 2022.Oil output from top shale regions in the United States is
due to rise by about 77,300 barrels per day (bpd) to a record
9.38 million bpd in February, the U.S. Energy Information
Administration (EIA) said in its productivity report on Tuesday.However, that monthly increase would be the lowest since
June, with growth shrinking on weaker productivity per well and
as inflation cuts into oil companiesâ€™ production budgets.Overall, U.S. crude production was on track to rise from
11.9 million bpd in 2022 to 12.4 million bpd in 2023 and 12.8
million bpd in 2024, according to EIA forecasts. That compares
with a record 12.3 million bpd in 2019.Olivier Le Peuch, chief executive at oilfield service
company SLB, formerly called Schlumberger, said he sees
onshore drilling activity in North America picking up as
companies look to rebuild drilled but uncompleted (DUC)
inventory.There "is a little bit of a shift to drilling to rebuild the
DUC inventory that will favor us in a month and a couple of
quarters to come before the usual plateauing or a moderation of
growth in the second half" of the year, Le Peuch said.The number of DUC wells in the seven biggest U.S. shale
basins fell to 4,521 in October 2022, the lowest in a month
since December 2013, according to federal data.The EIA said this week that producers drilled 1,011 wells in
the seven biggest U.S. shale basins in December 2022, the most
since March 2020. That helped boost total DUC wells in those
basins by 40 to 4,577 in December 2022, the most since August
2022.
