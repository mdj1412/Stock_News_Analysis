(Alliance News) - On Friday, major European stock markets contravened expectations by opening in negative territory on the last trading day of the week and ahead of data on service sector performance in the Old Continent's major economies."European markets rallied sharply yesterday after the Bank of England and the European Central Bank both raised rates by 50bp, with the DAX closing at a new 11-month high and U.S. markets posting a strong session. While central banks would like to give the impression that they still have time to raise rates, markets are of the opposite view, assuming, rightly or wrongly, that we are close to a peak as far as rates are concerned and that, although they are not done yet, they are close, with bond yields falling sharply across the board," commented Michael Hewson, Chief Market Analyst at CMC Markets."The assumptions that have emerged over the past two days are certainly many, but this week's market price action tells a different story than what we have heard from all three central banks over the past two days. While the central banks are essentially saying that they are still waiting for a rate hike, the markets are saying that we don't believe you and that even if you raise again, you will have to cut again by the end of the year."Thus, the FTSE Mib is in the red 0.6 percent at 26,9444.50, the Mid-Cap is down 0.4 percent at 44,281.86, the Small-Cap is in the green 0.1 percent at 29,975.01, while Italy Growth is in the fractional green at 9,546.32.In Europe, Paris' CAC 40 gives up 0.7 percent, London's FTSE 100 is on the parity line, and Frankfurt's DAX 40 is down 0.8 percent.On the main list in Piazza Affari, Pirelli is at the top, in the green by 1.3 percent, followed by the banking sector with UniCredit still grinding out gains after the accounts and rising 1.2 percent and Intesa Sanpaolo in the green by 0.8 percent on the day when it is expected to publish its own.
