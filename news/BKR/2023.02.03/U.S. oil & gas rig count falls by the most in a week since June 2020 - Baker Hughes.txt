Feb 3 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms this week cut the
number of oil and natural gas rigs by the most since June 2020,
energy services firm Baker Hughes Co said in its closely
followed report on Friday.The oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future
output, fell by 12 to 759 in the week to Feb. 3, the lowest
since September. <RIG-USA-BHI> <RIG-OL-USA-BHI> <RIG-GS-USA-BHI>Despite this week's rig decline, Baker Hughes said the total
count was still up 146 rigs, or 24%, over this time last year.U.S. oil rigs fell 10 to 599 this week, their lowest
since September, while gas rigs dropped by two to 158.U.S. oil futures were down about 8% so far this
year after gaining about 7% in 2022. U.S. gas futures,
meanwhile, have plunged about 46% so far this year after rising
about 20% last year.Overall, U.S. crude production was on track to rise from
11.9 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2022 to 12.4 million bpd
in 2023 and 12.8 million bpd in 2024, according to federal
energy data. That compares with a record 12.3 million bpd in
2019.Gas production was to rise on track to 100.34 billion cubic
feet per day (bcfd) in 2023 and 102.29 bcfd in 2024 from a
record 98.02 bcfd in 2022, according to federal energy data.Gas consumption, however, was on track to fall to 86.74 bcfd
in 2023 and 85.79 bcfd in 2024 from a record 88.72 bcfd in 2022.Analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co said the gas market
was heading for an oversupply situation and the gas "price needs
to head lower to clear the decks of unwarranted supply growth
... to force operators to shut down drilling plans."Drilling contractor Helmerich & Payne this weekwarnedthat weaker gas prices could prompt a shift in drilling
work, with some equipment moving to shale regions more heavily
focused on oil production.It also said oil and gas producer budgets are slated to
be "moderately higher" in 2023, with activity also anticipated
to grow modestly in the coming months.Exxon Mobil Corp, which this week postedrecord annual profitsof $56 billion, boosted spending in new oil and gas
projects last year by 37% to $22.7 billion.Investments can go up to $25 billion this year, Exxon
Chief Executive Darren Woods said, part of it explained by
rising costs in the Permian, with inflation in the double
digits, amid "really, really hot" demand for equipments and
services.
