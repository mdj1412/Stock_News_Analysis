Feb 24 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms in February cut the
most oil and natural gas rigs in a month since June 2020, with
the gas rig count falling to the lowest since April, energy
services firm Baker Hughes Co said in its closely
followed report on Friday.The oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future
output, fell seven to 753 in the week to Feb. 24. <RIG-USA-BHI>
<RIG-OL-USA-BHI> <RIG-GS-USA-BHI>Despite this week's rig decline, Baker Hughes said the total
count was still up 103 rigs, or 15.8%, over this time last year.U.S. oil rigs fell seven to 600 this week, while gas rigs
were unchanged at 151.For the month, the total oil and gas rig count was down 18,
falling for a third month in a row for the first time since July
2020.The oil rig count was down nine in February, while the gas
rig count also fell nine in its biggest monthly drop since April
2020.U.S. oil futures were down about 5.3% so far this
year after gaining about 7% in 2022. U.S. gas futures,
meanwhile, have plunged about 45% so far this year after rising
about 20% last year.Weaker energy prices are expected to impact drilling
activity, which was recovering from pandemic-related cuts, but
slowly due to rising labor and equipment costs and as many firms
were still more focused on returning money to investors and
paying down debt rather than boosting production.To avoid a looming oversupply situation in the gas market
that has already caused gas futures to drop to 29-month
lows this week, many analysts have said producers will have to
cut the number of rigs drilling for gas this year.Shale companies have been pulling back on gas activity as
prices have slumped.Gas-focused producer Chesapeake Energy Corp said
this week it planned to drop three drilling rigs this year and
reduce well completions activities.Rival Coterra Energy said it expected its oil volumes to
grow by about 2% this year, while its gas output would decline
1% versus the prior year.Oil prices will likely climb to the $90-$100 a barrel range
by this summer, the chief executive of shale producer Pioneer
Natural Resources said.
