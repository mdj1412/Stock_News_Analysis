*LNG overbuild could spark gas price volatility*Demand uncertainty clouds LNG project approvals(Adds byline)HOUSTON, March 14 - A flood of liquefied natural gas
(LNG) export projects due online worldwide in mid-decade will
vie against lower-cost renewable energy and a revived nuclear
power sector, which could rock gas prices and hurt some proposed
projects, analysts say.Proposed and approved new LNG plants would boost LNG supply
by 67% increase to 636 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by 2030
from 2021 levels, potentially saturating the gas market."There's over a trillion dollars of natural gas
infrastructure being built in the world today. There's a set
secular shift and natural gas that is here to stay," said Jack
Fusco, CEO of LNG exporter Cheniere Energy at a conference in
Houston last week.In Qatar, a massive LNG expansion project will add 49 mtpa
by 2027. U.S. projects could add 125 mtpa (16.4 billion cubic
feet per day) of capacity by late 2027, according to data
compiled by BTU Analytics, a FactSet company.In a taste of the potential volatility those projects might
face, LNG prices last year soared on European demand, then slid
as storage filled and customers pushed back against the high
prices and switched to other energy sources.That shift is only going to accelerate. In 2021 alone, wind
and solar's share of global power generation jumped to more than
10% from just 1% a year earlier, climate think tank Ember
estimates.At the same time, nuclear is rebounding: Japan aims to boost
nuclear's share of its power to at least 20% by 2030 from less
than 7% last year. France is proposing to build six nuclear
reactors by 2035.DEMAND UNCERTAINTYAnalysts see LNG prices remaining strong until around 2027,
but after that they may fall as the demand outlook is hazy."One big uncertainty the industry is focused on is how much
damage the high prices has done to medium-term gas demand," said
Michael Stoppard, who leads global gas strategy at S&P Global.S&P Global pushed back its demand growth outlook for LNG
from emerging markets by two years due to the spike in prices.LNG has "acquired a reputation as a costly and unreliable
fuel" that could jeopardize plans to build new import terminals
in Asia, the region with the highest demand outlook, the
Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said in a
report last month.China cut its LNG purchases by 20% last year on COVID-19
curbs and price volatility. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh also
slashed combined LNG purchases by 16% last year, IEEFA said.PROJECTS AT RISKIn the U.S., gas markets saw a volatile start to the year
after a relatively mild northern hemisphere winter and higher
LNG prices which led to conservation sent U.S. prices below the
cost of new production and led to a retrenchment in drilling.Muqsit Ashraf, who leads Accenture Strategy, expects solid
demand to support LNG prices through around 2027."What happens after that is more of a debate and depends on
how investment decisions play out this year," said Ashraf, who
previously headed Accenture's global energy practice.Baker Hughes, a major LNG equipment supplier, warned
in January that cost inflation and higher interest rates had
slowed the pace of LNG final investment decisions.Still, it anticipates "significant growth" in project
approvals this year. The year's first came on Monday, with
Venture Global LNG authorizing the second-phase of its 20 mtpa
Plaquemines LNG project.The risk is projects will come online just as demand growth
slows and hit global LNG prices."When you hear people say 'there is no way we will overbuild
this,' that's when things get over-built," said Alan Armstrong,
CEO of U.S. gas pipeline operator Williams Companies which
supplies gas to LNG exporters.
